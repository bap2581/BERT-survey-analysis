      "I joined the Enlisted Reserve Corps and took 6 months training in radio and was under the impression that when I was called to active duty I would be assigned to a signal corps outfit, but instead after completing basic training I was put in an Aviation Engineer unit as a basic (521) unloading and reloading box cars. I've practically forgotten everything I learned about radios now after being in the Army over a year and not having the opportunity to attend any radio school or be assigned to the Signal Corps. I've been promised that I would be sent to radio school at three different post, but it never materialized. I'm satisfied with what I'm doing now, but it is really disappointing to be faithfully promised something and you set your mind on it and yet it doesn't come through. If I could have gotten enough training n radio during my stay in the Army I would probably go into that field after the war.\n",

What will be his reward after the war? Will he come back home to be burned at the stake, dragged through city streets, and hung from trees? Will he be turned away from a job making a decent living because his face is black? Will our government permit such conditions of persecution, and oppression to continue? If so what has the American Negro Soldier gained by his sacrifice? [unclear] [/unclear] let its [unclear] have [/unclear] a [unclear] [/unclear] both on [unclear] the [/unclear] battle and the home fronts of this war.

I have met and talked with many white soldiers who had never been in the south before the war and had an opportunity to see what was going on. They seemed a bit disturbed about this thing also. Many of them had not realized what Jim Crow really was. I think that this condition is the condition that should be corrected after the war. The United States is a nation of Christians. Christianity begins at home. The main thing is, is our house in order? I think that thousands of soldiers white and black can answer that question. Men like Talmadge of Georgia the governor of Mississippi are not worth the powder to blow [insertion] them [/insertion] to hell.

It was pitiful to see grown men crying at being separated from their buddies; maybe never to see them again. Why wouldn't they send the whole Regiment? The Division to which they went still isn't up to strength with infantry men and they're getting them from somewhere else, instead of taking us.

If an organization have good clerk higher ranking Officers & NCO's worry about everything. For example if a certain report has to be out by a certain time. The CO Clerk will have to see that it gets out even if it takes working all night long and then if it goes through to higher officials and something may be wrong with it, it is ?? from the highest officers and down through channels to Co Clerk and all he has to use is the typewriter. We make all corrections and does most of the ??? and is marked Corporal for the duration. I think a little consideration should be given to the Company clerk.

Possibly in the next eight or ten years there will be another depression. The harbinger of this is usually the outbreaking of disturbances in the European countries as well as the Asiatic.

I have felt it more so since coming into the service, because my duties took me to places where segregation and discrimination were practiced on large scale. many of these practices were on the post it's self and others to and in the adjacent towns. I was not treated as a service man doing a great job for his country but as a lowly animal. This has been the greatest stumbling block in my path. If only this black could be removed. After all if this is read I am sure you will find this is the worst condition prevailing in and out of the army that my people dislike. We just ask for economic and social equality. I guess you know my race.\n",
      "Before I was old enough to be in the army I saw posters saying \"Uncle Sam needs youth\" Well, I volunteered for the army. I had three mos of school and then I was sent to a service company. I think there are better places in the Army fir the youth of this country because they are better as combat troops than older men who cannot stand up under the strain. I think the youth should get a better break and see more action.\n",
      "I think after the war the conditions will be much better in the United States like better jobs, more pay and most of the states might change.

      "The Army is a damn good thing for a man who is interested in new hells of life. [paragraph] I have been in the service for two years and I like it o.k. I was interest[ed] in Army life before I was drafted and so when I came in, I knew 1/2 of the score. [paragraph] There is only one fault. This life tears down a man's dream for a home and a family. The majority of the men in service today only look forward to going back home to the ones that they love and I, for one, intend to do so. \n",
      "Don't Draft a family man unless its necessary. Stay out of Foreign Affairs at all times unless its important you get involved. Put a family man at the bottom of the draft list. Keep him there as long as he can work and be with his family. Always keep a standard army. Draft boys into service as part of their schooling. Let men who has a family go home to them as soon as possible.\n",
      "If the United State opposes dislike the way the Germans treat the Jews and men of the conqued [conquered] nations why do they stand for race segregation on army posts and allow civilians to kill negro service men in the South and get away with it If negros [Negroes] are fighting for freedom.

I do not see what what use answering these questions will be in bringing about new conditions, but as broad minded person I will give anything a trial once - at least it shows a try, and nothing can beat it but a failure.

If I had stayed in civilian life I could have continued to buy war bonds, victory taxes etc. Therefore, I think that I could be of more help in civilian life than K.P. in the army.\n",

For this reason the negro soldiers morale is lower than any other groups in the army. he is realizing now that the democracy in this country is not as good as it is supposed to be. After the war he feels as though the conditions here in the army are much worse and will be there much worse than in civilian life. He therefore doesn't want to be in the army after the war.

In most cases in fact in all cases enemy citizens have been and are still getting preference over the negro, socially and economically. I don't think the United States in time of war has showed its appreciation for the fact that the negro soldier is also giving his life and sacrificing for a country that doesn't recognize him as a citizen. Prisoners of war should not be permitted to remain in the United States. Alienists should be granted secondary rights to all American citizens. \n",

Why not leave the northern boy up north and vice versa. The average Southern boy will get less after the war, because the south is building plans already to apprehend them. The average Negro fighting the war doesn't know what he is fighting for. Ask him and see? Camp Planche is a hell hole and not fit for dogs.

Take my home state wont let me vote. how do you think I feel about going back to live there. Maybe after I've been in some forgen country dodging bullet and death. There'll be many new problem after the war. and I think if they are not handle right there will be a lot of blood shed.\n",
      "I like the Army fairly well, but I don't feel I am fit to stay in the quartermasters, what I like is the Medical Corp.

      "I've been in the US Army for near 3 yrs in the South. My personal opinion of the Army in the South, I'd hate to say in words. I've been neglected and refused of all privilege that a solider should have. When I was inducted in the Army I had a clear understanding that \"War\" has no race nor does it have any color. War has two relatives Victory and Defeat. We the people of the U.S.A. need more cooperation in order to promote tranquility. The U.S. Army has very little respect for a negro soldier in the Southern States. Conditions are critical in [underline] \"Texas.\" [/underline] \n",

I'm wondering that after the war is over will there be the same doings by the southern whites as there was before this war all over.\n",

      "To my opinion, the Negro soldier is not treated in any Post, Camp or station, like he is fighting a war for democracy. Which mean as stated a million of times, Freedom of Speech, all men being created equal, regardless of race, Color or Creed, a right to vote a right to live as a decent man. I have seen soldiers hung and no investigation made. The Negro soldier as I believe is in one Army and then theres the Army. The Army doesn't have discipline now as it once had. These young white officers only molest the Negro soldier to an extent to almost [unclear] [/unclear] a social disaster. My own case for instance I volunteered to join the Infantry, and was reduced to the tirade of a Pvt for doing it. As far as AR's & N.O. Circulars in some units the white officers completely overlook them. I've seen it in at least 4 units of QM. This should be ceased. After the war, in my own estimation and listening to the Conversation of men. I think trouble may even leak out. I only hope this get in the hands of the right man, whom can put a stop to this.\n",

We all realize that there is a war on I am not worries about it but 6 months after this is over a man could advance a great deal in that time. I think my own business could advance very rapid in six months. Please reconsider I think it would be wise. Another thing after the war this thing called discrimination if enough consideration was given it could be disbanded. We are all men fighting for the same thing & be he black or white all blood is the same color think about that.\n",
      "I think that there is too much segregation in the army and for that reason the result is dissatisfaction, low morale, lack of interest. This camp which I am in (Cb Hood Texas) is in my estimation the worst place in the U.S. for a negro soldier to receive his training due to segregation, as far as recreational facilities are concerned, even on the post.

The South should be made to [unclear] [/unclear] its Jim Crow laws.

I suppose married men think they should be the first ones out but most of the young do have parents waiting for them and their just as important as any wife.

But as a whole the army has made a wiser man out of me. It has taught me the value of money.

When things like this happen and nothing is done about it how do you expect a soldier to feel? The Government should past the \"Anti Lynch Bill\" To defend my country I feel it my duty to do my part but, I could help them more but being at home. The transportation is terrible at this camp.

So why waste my time trying to tell you about it.

      "The Army as a whole is a pretty fair organization. But they have their faults as well as the good part of it. I've enjoyed being in the Army for the experience but I would appreciate civilian life much better now. The reason for saying this is because of my physical condition. I was injured in April 1943 in my stomach and I have never gotten over it. Also I've had a cold since March 1943 and they claim its [it's] nothing can be done about. Once since I've been in this squadron a Doctor offered to put me in Guard house if I came on sick call anymore. I was told that when are sick to always report to sick call. So there I was sick and not able to recieve [receive] medical attention from the Army. What to do but dig in my pocket and pay a civilian doctor to try to cure me when the Army should be doing that. Now [not] only that but several other instances I don't care to mention. They are always speaking of Democracy the Negro knows of Democracy. [unclear] [/unclear] because it is sent [isn't] practical although we are in the Army we have to face prejudice & discrimination which is not democratic. If we should get a break it is now. If you make ratings get a few medals or honor the White soldier looks at you as if to say What the hell he's doing with that he's not as good as I am. That's damd [damned] pill to face while fighting for your country don't you think?\n",

The Negro is not just a laborer he too, like any other man is a man, given the right to think and do as he so desires. He speaks, dresses, and goes to the same schools as any other, and surely, above all else, he too, is fighting for his country and freedom, the freedom that he has been denied on any number of times for many years.

Also I believe a great many men could be released from training camps as their maintenance and continued training would be a needless waste of material & money. In releasing men from the service, I believe that machinery could be set up similar to the induction stations. In other words, a man could be sent home through the same channels. I think that draft boards could be coordinated with Veterans Employment Agencies andbetween them they should see that the returned service man is offered an opportunity to return to the job he held prior to his induction, granting that he is physically and mentally qualified.\n",

I also wanted to get in the parachute. Better but they fail me. and put me in the quartermaster Corps. Wouldn't even let me be examine for either one of them. Of course all States is not alike.

While in Mississippi, we Negro soldiers were treated worse than enemy soldiers. We were puzzled at this strange treatment because we were making [unclear] [/unclear] sacrifices. Many of us developed a strong hate for white authority, the United States Army, and especially the Jim Crow South. I do say at that at times morale was so low in my outfit that some of us would have gladly sided the enemies in order to destroy white superiority. Jim-Crowism must be banished from the U.S. Army.

They are very incompetent and haven't the mental ability to lead a group of men in the Air Corps. I think the Air Corps should train it's own officers and non commissioned officers. The idea of taking an infantry officer or 1st sargeant from ?? or Engineers etc. And placing him over a group od Air Corps men does not work and I personally think it is one of the great mistakes the army has made. That is one reason or big reason moral is low and non cooperation in this Air Corps. A man does snot feel so good when driving for a good and have the Army take a first sargeant to ?? Infantry etc. and put him right in Air Corps as 1st sargeant for no reason at all. We have come here for good of the whole sqaudron please get rid of him.\n",

The one I will never forget is the one I had to put in a long distance call to my home and the only phone available at 10 at night & it was at the white service club. I went there but was told that the Negros were not allowed to use the phone this hurt me very much as my call was very important. there should be something done about such situations because where you are wearing the uniform of the US I think we should be accorded the same privileges as white soldiers or at least the same accomodations that is only fair if these minor things were corrected I would do most anything that my country asked of me ?? with out prejudice in my heart.\n",

Follow the Russian procedure: make it a Federal law that segregation toward any race of people is a \"Crime\" and enforce that law, then we have the \"Democracy\" which at the present is only a \"joke\". (2) Consider the problems of the enlisted men in the Army as well as as those of the Officers - too many Officers are beating the Army \"rap\" for trivial disturbances, while the physical and mental condition of the enlisted men are being ignored. (3) Non-prejudiced Officials should investigate Army Camps more often and more thoroughly to see that certain War Department Directives are being complied with.

Conditions at this post are the worse [worst] I have seen any place since my comming [coming] into the Army. Certain officers their Authority to take advantage of the enlisted man, which in turn makes a very bad soldier and causes hatred against races. Which in time causes racial hatred. The colored soldier is a tool to do the dirty work.\n",

Why should they send out circulars and bulletins asking for volunteers when they haven't any intention of taking them into consideration. If it was a case of illiteracy on my part, it would be a diferent story; but my Army T.Q. permits me to enter O.C.S. although I hadn't given it a thought.

With the amount of women working on jobs that were otherwise held by men, it's going to be quite a time for soldiers dismissed from service to find employment. There are a great number of civilians that are on jobs that they held before the war and they're going to be first choice for work.

      "I think the army draft boards are very poorly seen because I came to the army long before many single men with less important jobs than mine. Also it is very unfair to draft men of my age & then less than nine months later all men of any age are indefinitely deffered. The army should also install in its doctors minds that they are to try & cure men instead of telling him he is a goldbrick wanting out of the army. The reason I say this is because I have never been on sick call in 14 mo. But once at a 63 exam I told a doctor that I ha been bothered with intermitent headaches for about 4 yrs. but I had never complained & would not have complained then if they hadn't been worse. He immediately began to show me where I was just trying to find an easy way out. When if this was my intentions why did I wait so long, I had been in 13 mo when I mentioned it. If I had been a soldier with a poor record it would have been justified but my service record is marked excellent as a soldier.

It seems as if the officers give responsible positions to persons they can dominate, rather than to those best capable for them. I sincerely trust that conditions for the Negroes, as to [unclear] [/unclear] security, and social freedom, will be greatly improved after the war.

The mass slaughter for the ability to be free in Europe and Asia while Negros see nothing of this freedom at home, can't be expected to cause him to expand with any degree of pride. Such Law Makers and Leaders: re Bankhead, Clark and Talemadge; segregation on this and other Posts too numerous to name, inability to enjoy common comforts offered to whites during travel, unhesitantly causes one who has suffered such humiliation to feel disgusted, resentful and completely dissatisfied. This that I have said, has every indication of continuation after the War. This is the United States as I see it in the Post War Era no changes from before except that of increased resentment on the part of the Ex-Serviceman (Negro) who will (as present conditions indicate) be forced to live under conditions for which he has just risked his life to change.\n",

I have been humiliated, insulted and made to feel inferior even in the Uniform I wore & the cause I represented. I have learned of prejudice laws being killed; laws that could have eliminated this condition in due time. These things have given birth to questions in my mind as to just how much better my future will be. I wonder if the reward the negro will get will be to come home to this unchanged situation. The law protects the southern condition therefore the law could change it. The negro can be worthwhile as a citizen & a credit to his race & America if he is only given a chance.

Knowing only of the situation as it exists in and around my company I can easily say that there has been a great mistake in the classification of the men. It is true that the army is made up of men from all over the country and men of all trades, but instead of the army classify these men according to their ability they do it just the opposite. I guess the army has its own methods for these procedures, but the army alone can make such a mess of it. It is true that the men in this army are doing a magnificent job but a better job could be done if only there were done in a more military manner than trying to fight a war with paper.

Well the past were again was Jim Crow until lately here and the government finally woke up and stop the Jim Crow and the past for Color other words, things maybe Ok but it just aint right for a man to give his live and then come home to find that the very people he fighting for is treating the enemy much better then him because his skin dark.\n",

Give them equal chance in the air force, Paratroopers, Signal Corps, and etc. They are fighting and dying for the [unclear] [/unclear] of property this country and rights, same as the white man. Give them equal right to vote all [unclear] [/unclear] the United States. And stop segregation in factory jobs, transportation, and living conditions. The negroes should be on the same basis as the white man. I think there will be a better and more cooperated country as a whole. I think congress as a whole is as much responsible as anyone else. The negroes should be given a chance to do the things that is best suitable to his profession.\n",
      "I really think that a colored man hasn't got much of a chance after the war because there is so much discrimination. I know that a lot of white industries aren't going to hire colored workers. Even when the war was going on and before I was in the army, my sister tried to get a job in the [unclear] b?? [/unclear] Waiter company. This company was doing work war, and just because she was col'd she did get the job. I did feel hurt. But there is nothing that I could do. That the main reason the makes most of the young colored boy's and girls go wrong. And I think that after this war it going to be worst. If all this different kinds of dis crimination are reason. Stop or come to an end. \n",
      "I don't think the conditions will be good for an ex soldier such wages will be cut despite from civelands about good paying jobs most soldiers will get a bad brake expecilly in the South on thos conditions, it will be hard for a colored soldier in the south.\n",
      "I have never approved of the army method of discrimination against the Negro soldier and the policy of sending Northern soldiers down to face the Jim Crow tactics in the South. Also the policy of forever keeping the colored man down underneath a white man regardless of his rank or in most cases nationality where I have seen occasionally cases in which German and Italian prisoners have been accorded more respect and allowed more privileges than the colored soldier who is fighting for a country that doesn't appreciate it.\n",
      "This being [deletion] [/deletion] the army of the most ideal democracy known, and fighting for freedom + equality, should know no impartiallity, yet it seems to me that is fosters the condition. [paragraph] If this cannot be corrected in the army, how can it be in civilian life??\n",
      "My ancestors fought for freedom, and I am now fighting for the same, but a place called the Mason Dixon line, is \"lynching\" the minority groups of races, which makes me feel as if it is no better to life under \"nazi\" dictatorship as it is to live under this present type of freedom of speech, freedom of rights, freedom of religion such a great government to live under.\n",
      "I don't think the Army gave me a fair deal. When I left Technical school I was promised a raise in grade. That which I haven't got yet. They put most of [unclear] our [/unclear] colored boys in service Units in the Air Corps, saying they are not good enough for anything else. [unclear] Our [/unclear] boys are good as anybody.\n",
      "Personally at my age I would rather be out of the Army altho I have learned many things [deletion] that [/deletion] I never thought of before. Have did things and work that I never thought I could do and if I were younger and no one but myself then I'd stay int he Army until they put me out with a pension.   -21-  RESTRICTED\n",
      "First, I will say that to my beliefs the army doesn't seem to much interested in how and where they place men. That is they give very little thought to qualifications of most of the men that come into the army. Second, there is great delay in paying the soldier in many parts of the country, yet during this time he [the soldier] must keep clean by all means, and take care of other personal necessities. The headline topic for discussion is \"the Place of the Negro After the War.\" During these troublesome times The Negro is still consider the inferrior when all the time he is trying to do his part so that after the war he can enjoy a better place [insertion] in which [/insertion] to live. He is doing his part, yes, but what does he get in return. He is turned away from public places with the excuse that \"We do not accommodate Negroes.\" His uniform is torned from his back, given punishment for having a mind of his own and called abusive names by supposedly intelligent superiors. Is that the type of place that I've been selected to shed my blood for? Why not \"right\" the \"wrongs\" at home before trying to spread our good thoughts to others.\n",
      "Before the war I dont think I was treated fairly, and I dont think it will be any different unless something is done for the Negroes equal rights.[paragraph] I dont like camp Plauche [New Orleans, Louisiana] and I dont like New Orleans. As for the camp theres nothing here to keep up the morale of the colored soldier. And in the city of New Orleans, the soldiers are treated much worse than the civilians. One store refused to sell me a cigar because I was a colored soldier.[paragraph] If thats the way we are going to be treated I'm still waiting for someone to tell me what I'm fighting for.\n",
      " This is a subject on which I could say plenty from the racial angle. Being a Negro however I'm not quite so sure that my opinions will be regarded seriously. This is not a complex. It is only tje result of knocking one's head continuously against obstacles caused by one's race [underlined twice] especially in the so called \"Lily White Professions!\" However I do hope [underlined twice] for an awakening to the underlining [IN ALL CAPS] RACIAL ISSUE THAT IS BEHIND THIS WAR. It is the result of one people trying to dominate another!! And if the United States leadership [underlined twice} isn't careful, It will be confronted with another war of states!! It is only that the low man on the totem pole is awakening and demands the equal rights of his [underlined and inside quotation marks} \"sky brethern\" regardless of his [underlined] paint! \n",
      "Don't you think it would be a grand gesture and the beginning of great progress if the people (of the United States) as a whole would have their eyes opened, their ignorance removed and their souls cleansed thus enabling them to recognize the sacrifices and losses of these returning men of all races and creeds and opening the heart of the country to them, repay them in full by merely practicing the democracy and equality which is so loudly preached? I know - wishful thinking but maybe someday.... someday......\n",
      "As a representative of the largest minority I am in doubt as to the benefits the colored man will receive after the war is over. At present I'm of the opinion that none of us are justified by serving outside the limits of the United States. As I see it, the fight with Germany is fundamentally for the preservation of Democracy. Democracy is a principle never fully realized by us. Many have been denied the right of popular vote which is the basis of democracy. Discriminative conditions present themselves all over the country. So our present fight for democracy is sort of ridiculous. [paragraph] In fighting Japan the main issue seems to be, \"The maintenance of white supremacy\" Again that is, to me, a ridiculous objective. I'm of the opinion no man, regardless of color, is superior to me or in prospective to my race. That is probably the main reason of the discrimination shows my race by the \"White America\". They are aware we are socially, mentally, physically and spiritually their equals or better. This jealousy may make life after the war considerably tougher, than maybe on the other hand, our merits may be justly awarded. [paragraph] \n",
      "I would like to say I hope we who are serving will get a descent break and miss the Depression which followed the last war. As a negro I know I will have a very hard time unless the government does something towards helping. The G.I. Bill of rights will be entirely no help to me at all. I have to start from scratch I've no colateral at all to fall back on I'm too old for school.\n",
      "Well personally I think conditions will be different after the war a lot of war plants may shut down and there won't be as many good jobs for everybody. Things may be no good for a couple of years, but I think the government should work out some plan or there may be a repetition of the conditions existing a few years after World War I. People should be encouraged to go into business and lent money if their endeavor is worthwhile, or helped to start a farm or whatnot because when the fellows get back they will want jobs and a break in life and if they don't get it things will develop because if they don't get a break they'll try to take it, what they rightfully deserve one of the main threats to this country is segregation. A lot of people lord it over a man because of race. When thoughts like that are abolished \"then\" there will be a new world where a mans a man regardless.\n",
      "Well after the war I hope a soldier gets a chance to earn a good living for his loved ones. And I hope that everyone whether he was in the army or not get a fair break. And I hope that every race is given as equal a break as the next race. I do believe that there will be enough work for everyone after the war. In one way to remedy this is to have all women that are working for their own soul [sole] support be allowed to work on but those who have husbands working be laid off to make room for some man that isn't working so able to take care of his family. I am hoping for the best to come for I believe everyone deserves to be contented to a certain extent after a war. For in more ways than one a war hurts everyone.\n",
      "I might emphasize the fact that the reason that prompted this little interview is by far one of the most important things to be considered in this post war world. Too much stress and time cannot be spent on plans for the soldier returning to civilian life. Let us correct by experience the mistakes we made during World War 1.\n",
      "I think the Army made a big mistake when drafting young boys as I am not merely saying this because I am young myself but because younger boys have a right to have wives nice homes and to enjoy life. I think between the ages of 20 - to 30 should have been selected.\n",
      "First I would like to say, I hope that what the fellows have sacrificed has not been in vain. All people should realize that it is of most vital importance to treat a stay as ours not a nation divided. The fellows in the services know that value and if everyone will take heed no other nation on earth will be as strong. As soon as the war is over we hope to find abetter and a more congenial life than we left. I know that in some ways the Army has done good and will have some very fine citizens. In return, but there must be a complete and understanding. If we hope to keep these kind citizens the best. On the whole I look forward to a happy return to my family and a bright future. I found the training very beneficial.\n",
      "I think that the ex-serviceman should be given priority in obtaining jobs for which he is qualified. I don't think that race creed or color should enter into the question when a person is applying for a position. He should be judged by his ability, how much he knows about the job and how well he can do the work. I also think that the United States should help the ex-servicemen as well as it can as long as the ex-servicemen do not abuse the aid. \n",
      "Frankly I wonder how any man can live in the illusion of hope that after this war the Gov will assimilate the black race, yet during her days of trial, why she is faced by aggressor nations from afar she permits to go unpunished against the negro that is a shame before the eyes of any man. I do hope that the Gov will make better provision than before, for the minority. Yet he take a look at Russia.\n",
      "The army should discard all race discrimination in these southern army camps and put segregations on equal and I think that would help bring up the morale.\n",

I willing to take orders and do but when I think I'm having the advantage taken of me I'm going to raise hell and do. Personally I don't think there is a man on the staff left that really knows his job. All of the men that were on the ball they transfer. It appears to me that the battallion commander is afraid to have any one around that knows more than he does. Now just how would you feel having enlisted Non-\n",

[paragraph] A big chunk has been knifed out of the soldiers life. He is at loose ends. He has not benefited by the war financially and there will be nothing for him afterward. [paragraph] I become frightened whenever my thoughts lean into the future. No family, no home, no money, what is to become of me. I will not be able to qualify for good jobs (professional) because of educational limitations. \n",
      "I personally think that condition after the war in the united states will be worse than they were before the war because a lot of the boy that have been over sea and have fought so they could come back to this place isn't going to stand for a lot of the shit that they use to take off the pregedist white man.\n",
      "I'm only a buck Sergent but I can see a great calamity after the war unless the negro soldiers is given half a chance as his white buddy who have both given their blood in the recent crisis. Time there had been some changes made but the home front has changed very little. I see dark days ahead and trouble [unclear] [/unclear]\n",
      "Since being ing here in the Army I have seen a lot of things that are very discouraging to Negros. I know of a certain soldier that passed his exam for OCS and his WOJG exam but never did get a go. Since there has been a world there has also been discrimination and parshabity [ partiality] shown towards the negros. Why is this? Most people think the negro is a problem but he isn't. No negro is a problem to his race but he can be a problem to himself. Not only the negro but the whole race of people. I have also seen that there are white boys in the office doing the same work with S/sgt stripes and yet every coloured person is a cpl or Pte. Why is this? But in my estimation I think conditions will be much better after this great tormoil [ turmoil]\n",
      "Well Im a repeat That we should fix our Armed Forces so as not to be caught with our pants down as we was before also we should make this peace real and everlasting and not fuck around like we did in World War I but brake Germany an Japan now and never let them out of our sight.

      "Personally after the war I think it is going to be very conjested [congested] - For those soldiers who since being in the army have lost contact with their families - wounded or injured beyond the ability to care for themselves & wish to remain in the & be cared for rather than going to some relative - I am sure that they will be given some good opportunity.\n",
      "There is a lot of improvement that could be made in the southern states, such as, giving certain groups better jobs as they would be able to educate their children for the new world that is being created now on the far flung battle front of the world. I also object to fighting for other people's rights, and freedom while I am partialy [partially] a slave here in this country which proposses to be the [unclear] Curenell [/unclear] of Democracy.\n",
      "The U.S. army is OK, as far as I am concerned, but it dont do one fare [fair] justice.

[colored] soldier in the south, they are not treated as the white.\n",
      "A man should be treated as a man & this idea of out ranking a man & using this as a way to do duty should be stopped. I think a buck Pvt. has feelings just as a Colonel. Everyone is the Army should do their own jobs. Usually something new comes out & the Col. is the last one to hear about & see it & the one o do it.\n",
      "I think every service man should be offered a job capable of his abilities in order to reestablish himself in the post war world. These jobs should be supervised by the government. This would ease friction between John Q. Public and G.I. Joe.\n",

Prejudice must stop in the army.\n",
      "I think it is very important that the Government and each state check on the youth of today that has been imployed [employed] instead of going to school to see that they go back to school for the future welfare of our country.

      "I feel the Army can become more democratic in one respect without any way detracting from the important element of discipline I feel that courts martial Boards trying Enlisted men should have Enlisted men on these boards. I believe this would be a great factor in attracting volunteers for the service I also think this would entice many men to remain in the army and make the military service their career. [paragraph]\n",
      "I think it would be a good idea if the army discharges more colored men than white as soon as possible after the war. If the colored men get out of the army the men on a whole will loose contact with each other and there will be less chances for organized race riots.\n",
      "I believe a soldier would have a better share to start from self a [unclear] [/unclear] after the war for himself and not the other man. The [unclear] [/unclear] all men who want to [unclear] [/unclear] something a chance.\n",
      "I have only this to say that if these people of the other seas don't wake up before this war is over that the black race will rool this country and that the white race will be the same place they have negro people now I would myself like to see one for all and all fore one. When there will be no crede or collar. The old saying it that my people pull one another down, but they have been gone to wake up and they shont all look ofr the white man to tell them what to do. So I would advise the northern collar people to wake up the negs of the south, they is the one who really need to be shown that they are free from slaves.\n",
      "I should think that the Army would [unclear] impregnate [/unclear] same [unclear] [/unclear] which supplied as means of [unclear] [/unclear] certain college curriculae that did not [unclear] suit [/unclear] the soldiers it seems and that the soldier[unclear] [/unclear] since in most cases education was Interupted because of the Army. The Air Corps has proven to be a very fine division of the Army, and I find the rate of intelligence overrates the regular army. It does seem logical the same few courses be given at least twice weekly I would suggest - Administration classes for those working in Administration etc.\n",
      "My greatest objection to present army life are my [unclear] [/unclear] and the distance from home. Of course I realize that most any type of man will be found in army camps but I think that the majority of us could be a little closer to home especially while in the U.S. I dislike being here also because there are so many idle single men in civilian life now who should be here in place of us married men, particularly those of us who really supported our families.\n",
      "There are a lot of men being transferred to combat troop that are physically unfit for field duty. These men are griping and that tends to lower morale in all units. There is also at some camp, a good deal of Sec[tion] VIII discharges that are being given to soldiers wrongfully. Not deserving a Sec[tion] VIII, these men are planning to fight any effort on draft after the war. A man injured in the service (not in combat) and in the line of duty should be given some consideration. [paragraph] As a whole, the Army is really a fine, modern place. I like it. I think every man should be required to take some [unclear] [/unclear] after the war - and most unemployed should be drafted for a 1 year period with one month off every quarter.\n",
      "I think conditions would be better if all men were treated on equal basis and given all chances possible regardless of race creed or color. Not only after the war is over, but even now. If this had happened before there probably wouldn't have been a war anyway. The main reson for this war was the greed of white men and his feeling of superiority over men of other races and colors. \n",
      "For the use that the negro troops have been used for as I see it they could have just as well been left out of the army all together. Men are just shifted around from place to place with the apparent intention of denying them their just dues. After the war I feel as though things will be in a bad fix financially as well as morally. With men being away from their homes for such long periods of time. It has been 10 mos. since I have been home, it is natural to look for a large percentage of broken homes.\n",

I have no personal grievance against anyone, but I know that I, like scores of other young, intelligent and ambitious Negroes who are clamoring to give their country the best of their service, have been misfitted and denied [deletion] the [/deletion] an equal opportunity to fight for our country.

We often ask ourselves what are we fighting for Democracy or civilized slavery? Among its courses the War Department should number a course in democracy, a true democracy as those unfortunates who have not been exposed to it may gather some of the true meaning. I have seen many potential qualified leaders rot, because their skin was black. Does this increase the efficiency of the Army? Why doesn't the Army give a man his just deserts, regardless of his race or color and quit ignoring his qualifications.

([paragraph] ) There is much waste of manpower - the army seems to feel it is quicker, easier to train some one for a job than it is to find those that already trained. ([paragraph] ) If a man does his work without complaint even menial tasks he is soon reassigned to that job. If he hollers a lot about a dirty job he doesn't get it as much.\n",
      "Reconversion is a great problem to look to after the war for the government. One knows, if one ever considers it, that all do not plan to return to the same jobs, under the same conditions, after the war. If this [insertion] was [/insertion] [deletion] [/deletion] [insertion] [deletion] [/deletion] [/insertion] so, the government wouldn't have to consider the adjust of reconversion [unclear] say [/unclear] too much. In other words, one day everyone will be making war material. Then comes the end of the war, and the next day finds everyone in the productions of civilian goods, and everything back to normal of [deletion] cil [/deletion] civilian times before the war, but that is not the case that will be. Many little places of businesses that have closed [deletion] before [/deletion] [insertion] after [/insertion] the war, even to the point of where some services men was employed, might not re-open when the war is over. That will, of course throw that particular service-man out of [deletion] [/deletion] a job, and at the same time, there will be many such places like that after the war is over, and service-men after the war that will be unemployed will presumably be [unclear] considere [/unclear] in the millions throughout the U.S. Thus, when the period of reconversion ends will be a great problem to the government, and to the people as well.\n",
      "In a way I think the army is OK. I enjoy it very much but I don't think [unclear] that [/unclear] the people in the south treat us as a soldier. I also think after the war we should all be treated alike Because we are all in this and should all come out together I think we should get what we are fighting for in all of the United States. Which I think we should all ready have. [Interchange arrow between \"Because\" and second line down from that.] \n",
      "the utter & complete stupidity if religious mighty & racial predjudice [prejudice] - MUST GO!!!!! the question if wether [whether] man can live with man as brothers - with equal respect for his rights, personal dignity & honor, can no longer be looked upon as desirable, but the continuance of \"peace\" throughout the world has now made it a [underline] NECESSITY [/underline] [paragraph] \n",
      "Being a negro I am [deletion] will [/deletion] very much interested the welfare of the Negro when this war is over. During the last two or three years there have been a considerable amount of reports from different sections of the U.S. of beating, killings, or other injustices against the Negro soldier, even on Army post, prisoners of war enjoying certain priviliges [privileges] , that are denied the negro soldiers. Who are fighting and dying for this God Dam country and there's nothing, not a God Dam thing being done about it. What the Hell are we fighting for? So some Son-a Bitching Peck o-Wood, down in Georgia or Texas, can go right on calling us \"Nigger' or hanging or beating you up because he's afraid you might fuck a white woman We don't want your Dam women. What we want is an equal opportunity, to compete for jobs The right to raise our family, the chance to help Government equal priviliges [privileges] under the Bill o Rigts [Rights] (soldier) or any thing else for the benefit of the soldier. What we want when this war is over is an chance to live by the principles which we are fighting for. [paragraph] \n",
      "I think that the Army should give the Negro soldier a better chance allow the qualified ones to enter into the branches for which they are best qualified. Abolish segregation and put Negro officers with more Negro troops. The government of the U.S. should adopt a definite policy and program for their intentions toward the negro. Mabe it compulsory for the Southern states to educate negros. I believe the only way to promote good feeling and trust between the white and black race is thru education. It is an insult to the intelligent negro to be put in the Service commission of the PM. Corps, labor battallions etc. In order for the Army to procure better morale it should abolish this practice. After all, we all are fighting for the same thing. Lets fight together.\n",
      "\"Yes just one thing\" I do hope that the day will come when the negros of the U.S.A. will get a fair play. \"Sign a good soldier\" \"by the help of God\" We are working fighting or buying bonds and even giving up our lives for the same thing Peace and freedom\n",
      "I as a negro soldier and being born and reared in the south would like to see the day soon when men would be men and women would be women whether they be black or white, where segregation would cease and all people could obtain jobs according to their skills and not because the color of his face was right or his hair was straight. If the past means anything negros who are employed in big jobs because there are not enough of other races will be the first to lose their jobs and go into poverty no matter how legal their skill may be.\n",
      "Well on conditions after the war so I will say when the war is over. The government should let all the men go home and stay for a time but of course he might and everyone should get a square deal both colored & white not just one as far as the army concern it is all right but it just the people in it.\n",
      "I feild [feel] like we Should have the right of any other Shoulders [soldiers] Wither [whether] are Black and we Should have work after this war like rest whit [white] people we all ar [are] shoulders [soldiers] and fighting for the same thing.\n",
      "Why does officers feels or acts like a soldier is not much in his eye sight. The supply Sgts. has the hardest job in the company, and only gets Staff Sgt, he has all that work to-day, looking out for the men equipment and ex equipment its no easy job at all. Conditions after the war will be the same, white people have all the rights, best of places to go, and they just go on thinking we are nothing, yet we were all fighting for them as well as our selves.\n",
      "Scence [since] my present into the army I have corestapond [corresponded] with a lot of Boy's from the South and I think the Southern condidions [conditions] for Negros should be better in the United States for them and allow them an equal brake [break] as every man should have. Other than that I think the United States will be a lovely country.\n",
      "Well all the officers seem to be very good here. The other camp (Ft Benning) was hell. The non coms were too much hell. They curse after you too much. I don't think the United States should have entered the war because they didn't start it.\n",
      "It should be a Law to stop the white people for taken the colored people land and trying to run over them. we all are trying to fight for the same thing to be free and live. the way it going on now we don't see no changes - and it will be the same after. [paragraph] So the black man is not Free at Mississippi. that is he is going to be done after war?\n",
      "Personally, as aforementioned I am undecided, but frankly, I think condition will have a tendency to seek their pre-war level. Those thing that are important enough to hold their level due to their firmness of hold may meet all opposition and withstand it, but a lot of things which have been given as mere appeasements will be taken away - These things naturally out weight conditions firmly entrenched and will put condition as they - were - We[insertion] will [/insertion] have again won the war and the scare will be over, so as water seeks it level so will conditions_ If education will [unclear] [/unclear] have its word in opposing those who try to drag down that which has been accomplished and built up, there is a definite solution, but how far are we from the educational approach as a solvent for conditions in this country I'll answer, far, far, away - I would like to sign my name -\n",
      "I realize the climate conditions in the South are rather ideal for training, but there should be some recognition of the soldier in uniforms, regardless of race, color or creed. It isn't fully realized that we; the Negro, are giving our lives in a cause to maintain peace, but also in doing that we are being treated like dogs in the South. The State laws apply to the White soldier, but to us it's just a more difficult problem to understand. To the Southern Negro it may not seem so bad, because it has been taught him all his life, that he must address all inhabitants of the South as Mrs, Miss, or more regardless of age so long as the skin pigment is different than his. To me a Northerner, I've been taught to give respect where respect is due regardless of the pigmentation of the skin. I leave this with you who are better suited to take action, and see what you can do.\n",
      "Post war conditions are utmost with me. I feel that our promises as to going back to various jobs we left will fall short. It is impossible to rehabilitate seven million or ten million soldiers. especially where we have brought Italian soldiers over that will be given civilization papers to get out and scuttle up some of the chances that we American soldiers might have. If we get rid if the refugees and prisoners by sending them back home and consider our men first it may help a lot to get us back in our various pre war channel. But old Liberal America just can't turn a guy down. She'll spite her neighbour for a begging enemy.\n",
      "If conditions aren't any better for the negro race after the war than they are now I'm afraid the peace in the U.S. will be very short. I thinks it's a national disgrace that negroes must shed their blood for privileges which they never receive. [paragraph] I think social conditions in the United States are deplorable + what makes if all the more disgraceful is the fact that all the Jim Crowism seems to originate from the capitol of the U.S. [paragraph] The constitution of the United States means absolutely nothing where the negro is concerned. The so called great congress of the U.S.is doing nothing what so ever to better the unbearable conditions.\n",
      "I think that the Negroe soldiers should have just a much of freedom and equal rights to anything in the United States. For we are in the service doing all we can as well as the White. When this has been gone in effect we will have a much better Army and Country. For God is no respector of persons but he that worketh righteous is accepted with him. So thank you. And may God's sweet blessing remain on our land and country May God Help you. Thru Jesus Christ our Lord - Amen.\n",
      "I feel if I was relieved I could do more for the cause as I am beginning to feel the strain as I am almost 38 years old and I somewhat suffer from headaches & rheumatism. I do believe if I had a define job I could be able to be in better health and be able to help more in that way - However I know not all the men want to be in the army. I would rather be out to perhaps better my health. I now can't sleep and it is ruining my health I have to be up and can hardly get enough sleep. I am rest broken so far as army is concerned. The mess section perhaps gets less sleep than any other branch and its also hard on your feet.\n",
      "My main hope is that after the war Race relations will be better and Negroes will be given a fair chance to obtain jobs for which they are qualified. I also have a desire to see more federal intervention in instances where Negroes are mistreated solely because of color.

      "I really would be proud after the war if they could stop these white people down here in the South from treating the colored soldiers and colored peoples as they has treated them. Its awful hard to be fighting for freedom + has to be Jim Crowed on trains, buses + ect. I don't think they should even send a colored soldier down south. They are treated just like they are dogs. They don't have any protection what so ever. If one is killed there is not any thing done about it. \n",
      "To my notion we have many southern whites who will actually take spits out of some innocent people for things they have seen in northern and western states where segregation is prohibited to a certain extent. They are probabl the cause of the soldier in England being almost hung. Why can't the Army officials conduct military discipline on army posts like they did before the war without the authority of civilians. Sheppard Field is practically run by them.\n",
      "As far as conditions after the war, I think something ort to be done to assure the negro a place in this Democracy after the war. So as he can prove to the [unclear] [/unclear] of thee American white that we all were created equal, that the white race is no better then the negro, or black race. [paragraph] What we would like is a chance to prove ourselves worthy of any position in this America, and we will make our way.\n",
      "I do not feel military minded at all because I do not feel that the country have my enterest [interest] at heart as much as the should. Being a negro in the army think that the negro soldier should be treated better than they are at present, why they even have segregated theater right here in my camp. Now I put the question to you how do you think I should feel? Will any thing be done about such matters\n",
      "I feel that if a outfit is run by officers of its race or color it would be of more good to the country than have them run by officers of another race. These officers do and will take more interest in the men than some of other races. Frankly I think there are more ill feeling in a Unit with officers of one race and enlisted men of another than there are in some with all one race. The Army often wonder why so many colod soldiers are AWOL In a place like this where he can't get out for some time months and in some cases more. Well what would they expect. After all we are human as well as other soldiers.\n",
      "I think the war has been of value to most people in one way or the best since it was most people want about such and quite so to the South. The American white in the South count the colored man of little value, leaves him without any opportunity regular has of federal ??? If education system in the south are poor very poor for colored, the color bar of America cost the Government more money than the war itself. In this I mean two of if why and one should serve the purpose as well.\n",

      "Being the minority group (racial) I can't help but bitch about the , shall I say \"undemocratic\" priviliges the army and for that matter the United States as a whole has towards the Negro troop. Its no wonder at all that the morale of the colored soldier is at low tide. A man will never put all is strength out to save a burning house if he knows he won't be allowed in the house when the fire is out. I often wonder who is doing more to win the war - The Negro soldier who fights and dies for his country, or Senator Bilby who fills the Congressional Records with ways and means to keep this soldier from bettering himself and his children. [paragraph] Among the postwar plans that the [unclear] Parre [/unclear] and his staff ha been making I still haven't read any concerning the Negro when he returns from the war.

If I should return from the battle field and find the same conditions existing I shall beel that our war has been a waste and those who died have given their lives for nothing.\n",
      "I believe that my morale would be much higher if it wasn't for so much Jim Crow in Camp and by civilians, and what hurts me so much is to think that I am to fight for such people as these, where they sit back and give my people the dirty deal they are giving. Such things as that makes me wonder what the hell I am fighting for. They intend for me to fight but treat me like a dog. Sometimes I wonder to myself will things like this be going on after the war is over and if so, will the boys that fought for these kind of people, will stand for it. But then I says to myself, I know if they do such things as that while I am fighting for them, I know that they will do the same thing when the boys come back home. Truthfully speaking for myself, I will not stand for it, and I know that the negro boys of today will do the same.\n",
      "I think that the army is undertaking a great task in trying to solve problems for soldier's after the war. I am just hoping that I can land a good civil service job so I can get started in life, that's [insertion] what [/insertion] most men want to do.\n",
      "In the first first place I don't like the army, never did and probably never will. I don't feel as tho' I've been given an equal chance to demonstrate my abilities as have others. Other [unclear] phases [/unclear] of [unclear] [/unclear] that I've experienced are the segregation and discriminatory practices that are enforced - esp [deletion] in [/deletion] Southern Post and army camps. Being a soldier of a minority race I cannot honestly say that I know what I'm really fighting for - It surely isn't a true Democracy. \n",
      "Personally, I don't think much of the Army, because it is not run by the strict Military procedures, especially where races are concerned. I can not condemn the Military laws & regulations because they are but written word, but I do condemn the heads of organizations such as Commanding officers etc. but there problem is the failure of the Army to take care of various matters which arises in all sections of the country. It is a poor Army when it cannot handle & protect it's people in its own country. [paragraph] Concerning conditions in the U.S. after the war; I think the people, regardless of the section of the country, race, creed or color, there should be [underline] \"enforced\" [/underline] as the Constitution of the U.S. calls for, a government of the people, by the people and for the people. [arrow pointing to previous writing] \"ENFORCED\" Until the Constitution of the U.S. is enforced in all of America, we cannot expect the conditions to be at its peak.\n",
      "I think while the higher command is planning the post war world they had better consider the Negro Soldier in it. There will be more blood spilled on this side than on the other if not we talk about Democracy and what the Nazi & fascest [fascist] or [are] doing when we should rebuild our own [unclear] forces [/unclear] and clean up our own back yard All of the Hitlers & Togo's over her [here] should received the same fate which is planned of those over seas\n",
      "The Army is overcrowded with Negro soldiers with nothing to do. Why do they retain them. We have thousands of qualified men doing nothing but shifting from camp to camp place to place. Their morale is on rock bottom their opinion of the army has changed. They hate it. Sooner the other idle hands will think the same and a conflict will arize sooner or later. I hope I never live to see it personally. I always make it a point to try and pacify the deep thinking soldier. Hes the one to watch. If you can keep him calm you have accomplished something. That of late is a problem. He's becoming more unruly each and every day. Its your problem not mine to figure out what to do for the Negro soldier.\n",
      "The army provided a lot of places for soldiers to go for recation [recreation] but i find that there are only a few places I am allowed. That is true not only in the South but also in the North. I would like very much to get out of the army and may be go some place where every one is treated like a man. We are all fighting for the same thing and i feel that we all should have the same break at anything the army offer. I will never make a soldier. This was nt only true in the States but over sea I found a lot of places I was not allowed but still I was there to help protect it. After risking my life I think to myself what have I to gain after during all this maybe things will change but I been in the army 3 years and it have been same everywhere I went.\n",
      "As a hold I think the army is alright but since I have been station I don't seem to feel the same. It seems every superior try to take the advantage of me. I think a lot could be done to build the moral of their post. I am getting [unclear] [/unclear] at the army.\n",
      "I would like to know why do you'll have to put a restriction on a E.M. for wearing a [unclear] [/unclear] cap [deletion] [/deletion] any other thing he would was to look like a soldier in As long as it have the same color [unclear] [/unclear] [unclear] there [/unclear] is no A.R. [army regulations] against such uniforms it is possible for a soldier to get better [unclear] [/unclear] in the company he is now serving in? I think treating the soldier a little better than you'll have been doing it would build his moral up and make him feel that he is being treated like a soldier, but at the mean time he is being treated like a prison even the prisoner of war get a better break than a soldier so I wish you'll would push same bull to stating what a man shouldn't be restricted for in uniform because the ground rule is an bad deal for a soldier so please relax on the statement.\n",
      "I do think that I could have done more for the war effort out in civilian life that I have being a soldier. Because when a man reaches the age of 30 or above if he is not physically fit you can not build him. Therefore if I had continued on the job as I was they probably could have drafted some one that would have been a little more useful and we both would have been doing out bit.\n",
      "I think I voice the opinion of America's largest minority groups when I say that all I want is the fundamental rights guaranteed by our constitution. At times we in the Armed Services, both here in the States and overseas, have reason to doubt ourselves. It seems as if we are fighting an uphill struggle, threatened at every turn to be crushed in our fight for what we all know to be right. We ask ourselves some time, \"why do we fight?\", when we're overridden by the \"lords\" and oppressed in this most important of all jobs. It doesn't take a great figher to dish out a beating, but it does take a great fighter to come back. We can only hope that after these many months and years of combat as brothers that the bond of brotherhood will not be broken but linked fast forevermore.\n",
      "What I am about to say is about the condition of the United States is about the way the white and Negroes get along in some sections of the states and they are suppose to be fighting for the same thing. Democracy the United States talk about fight Democracy in Europe and Asia and yet they haven't established it in the states in some sections. The race riot in Penn. happened because the railway company hired six negroes the white walk off the job this kind of stuff have got to be stopped after the war so the United States might have another civil war on her hand the negroes are dying and fight in this war to. You hear about the white troop in newspaper and over the radio but you never hear about the colored soldiers that fight and die. You don't hear about the 93rd division and [unclear] [/unclear] inf in Bouganvill fighting and dying no where but in a Negro newspaper but all that will come to light some day.\n",

Although I am trying to do my best and [unclear] find the help officers? [/unclear] I will never come some day. I don't like the set up in the south concerning the service in some places I have been. It is a racket. Officers and non commisioned officers have [unclear] picks + Classes? [/unclear] . I feel like we all should be treated a like. We are all fighting for the same cause. May God bless us.\n",
      "yes I have. we are suppose to be fighting this war a war for Democracy and as far as I can see Democracy really mean anything at all as far as the Negro are concerned I will try and tell you why. Ive been in the army quite while and have been many places and everywhere I've been we seem to get the neck of the bird if you get just what I'm talking about. I'm here in on the west coast. The place is strange to some of us yet there's others that have been here before the place is fine but everywhere we go we find that old familier [unclear] Phase [/unclear] discrimination but yet we're wearing the same uniform. I would like to say more but the thought of it all gags me.\n",
      "I'm hoping conditions in the United States after the war will have improved by the way of Race Relationships. The war should have told the world that separate class groups and Racial groups only breed hatred and prejudices witch form, Riots, strikes, mobs, strong arm [unclear] [/unclear] the carrying of concealed weapons and jim crow. The class with the most followers will divide and conqueor with its Dictatorship in a base form.\n",
      "If not farming or mining I would like very much to have a government job of some kind.

As for the Army I could stay in it if I was in the North somewhere I have been here 2 years and only had 23-days furlough have been a good Soldier in fact all of the Soldiers in the Camp any are good Soldiers but we do not get the kind of Justice that is due us as American Soldiers. But I hope some one can see my side and help me in getting transferred north.\n",
      "I have seen more fully since this war started just the type of raw deal the American Negro had been getting. It is especially apalling [appalling] to consider Jim-Crow & Segregation in the army itself - seemingly fully sanctioned and approved by it. I should think that since the Negro soldier has taken as much and in most cases more risks & has been given the more arduous and more unsavory jobs to do he should get his due consideration as his just reward. I feel that the Negro soldier deserves now more than ever the equal opportunity to all of the things held and all of the priviledge [privilege] enjoyed by other groups in America. Since in this war as never before he has [unclear] [/unclear] the military and industrial burden equally as well and with equally as much physical or mental jobs as any larger group. In truth the Negro should be able to demand his rights on the basis of his proven achievements.\n",

      "I think that if the Army as a hole want to get more me. They will have to brake up the segaration in the Southern Camp.

It makes a man of you if you are delicate or frail in some type. Now a little of the subject the average soldier when he is in the army is torn down preparing him for what might be, it breaks down that soldiers moral [morale] . As a negro soldier I speak as I feel individually. The negro troops are not equal in every thing as they could be comparing them with other troops of other countries. Their training is in some ways different. In some places our rights, authority has been deliberately taken away.

Under such existing conditions who wants to fight against something thats happing [happening] on foreign lands when they need to Start fighting here in their own back yard.

      "The army has gone to extraordinary pains to work against \"democracy\" in spirit + in letter and to equal lengths to prevent the nature and true danger of fascists and nazism from becoming apparent to the solider. In Lieu of this potentially terrific spirit-instiller, it has had to build up morale by falling back on race prejudice(war against Japan), + a weak \"strong man\" thereby (to explain Hitler). Whether the army's protestations that it only reflects civilian opinion are true does not matter. The fact is that conditions in the US will be influenced by the Army mentality's mis-handling of the ideological aspects of war.

There should not be any conflicts between races, about jobs and other conditions that may arrive. Regardless of their color or nationality we have the wright to live, work, hold religious services, have justice in law & court etc. where ever we are. The South should be cleaned and all hatred between men should be abolished.

Why [deletion] [/deletion] isn't something done to get the \"Anti-Lynch Bill\" and the \"Poll Tax\" Bill out of Congress. If this Country be Democratic why is there so much segregation in Federal organizations. The Army definitely included.

Segregation in the army between races should be absolutely discontinued.\n",

Many of them have broken through that wall and fighting to bring more through. But [unclear] [/unclear] are called and patted on the back to fight for this so called freedom. We have been told that after this war there will be a lot of changes made. I hope and pray it will because I don't think [unclear] [/unclear] younger boys will stand for anything like that that happen in the last war.

Such a step wold speed victory, build the morale of the Negro soldier, and guarantee that the post war period in our own country would be a just, a democratic period. In addition to such a committee in the war department, a real progress in fighting, educational program should be developed for both whites & Negroes to improve understanding and develop a cooperative spirit between the two centers\n",

The German prisoners of War walking around with one (1) guard to twenty (20) men while garrison prisoners has two prisoners to one guard.

In all seriousness, the overall planning and organizational set-up of the Armed forces is something to marvel at from the academic and administrative viewpoint. However, the Southerner and his backwoods attitude as regards relations between the negro and white races is too prevalent and a too influential factor in the Army. The Southern attitude of segregation & discrimination in the Armed Forces has been expensive, hindered the over-all war effort. It has been no less than a form of sabotage to the war effort for it has hindered many a negro American from making his most beneficial contribution to the war effort.\n",

After all that's what I'm supposed to be in the army fighting against. Free the world. But what about installing Democracy 100% over here. The Negro gave his blood as well for this Capital of so called Democracy. As far as the South is concerned, the Gestapo methods and code they live by are practically the same and on the same basic principles as the Nazis. Why not send all Negro and Jew and Catholic haters to Germany or Japan after the war. I'm sure those individuals would be in a world of their own and could live as sadistically as they chose. I thank you for this opportunity to speak my mind.\n",

Is it that he has fount harder than me in this war. I can see on advance in the future for me and my race. If we sit down and take what we are being given now. To get what we want we must fight for it. When the war is over I'm planing to be married and raise a family can I be sure they will be giving a fair chance to life or can I be sure I'll be able to previde for them. To do these things I must have a decent job. Will I be sure of getting a job or will I be turn away because I'm a Negro. I love this country because it's [unclear] the only one I know [/unclear] but the thing we are fighting for the thing we are dying for is not in this country. To have democracy we must start at home [unclear] [/unclear] spread abroad. There was such a thing as Democracy once but that was when Washington was living, and the Declaration of Independenc is now a thing of the past. Read the Declaration of Independenc to the people of this country and let them know just know what it means and then maybe the world will be what it really should be. \n",
      "First there is too much segregation in the Army. There are lots of things that are said to be in the Army but are not. Every soldier are supposed to have equal rights in the Army but they don't. The Negro troops have almost been told that they are not equal. There have been some few things done here in the states that weren't so nice for the Negro soldier in this war, the Negro troops never have the chance that the white soldiers have. The Negro soldier have a lot of this service work to do such as making officers beds, working BOD etc. And if they are doing very much in combat we hear very little of it. After this war I think the Negros will demand more rights. I am afraid there will be quite a ??standing in the US after this war.\n",
      "I can't say what I think the conditions of war will bring or rather [whether] it will be for the best or worst. But I do hope that what ever is being done to stamp out the backward motion of our condition (that is if there will be a backward-motion) will be effective as the European warfare is at the present & I have a lot of confidence in the European movement. I hope that our government will look out for all of its ex servicemen in regards to their future success & welfare.\n",
      "In a way being in the army has been an education to me. I have learned many things about people that will help me in the future life. Since being in the army I've learned to value many things I once thought had no value. [paragraph] After the war I think it will be a bit hard for a service man to get adjusted to civilian life and people, but in due time everything will work out alright.\n",
      "I do sincerely hope that living conditions for the lower classes of people will improve greatly. [para] The primary problem facing the country today is racial hatred. Until something is done to cure the prejudices toward the Negro Race, there is no hope for complete unity and cooperation.\n",
      "I really think the Army of the U.S. is as dictatorial as any other Army. I think most of the officers are overrated, and a whole lot of the present stock of Non Coms [non-commissioned officers] . I had an officer to tell me once that I was suppose to treat a General as if he was God. Every since then Ive had an intense dislike for the Army. Even though I conscientiously try to do my job as well as I can. I am not one to bitch where it will hurt the cause but I am not a professional soldier and have no desire to be one. [paragraph] I had to show my furlough six times in two hours at Chicago Union Station and then got a ticket for wearing a pair of gabardine trousers that I've worn for two years. [paragraph] I hope the day will come that the negro soldier will get the same break as the white soldier\n",
      "After this war, I would like to have the assurance that we had fought a good battle. [paragraph] That assurance could come in the form of a democracy at home. [paragraph] I mean a true democracy at home. This is the second war for one objective. [paragraph] We don't want to fight a third battle for the same thing. Nor do we want a second civil war. [paragraph] Only with a \"Democracy\" at home can our future dreams become realities. [paragraph] Our nation was built by dreamers. [paragraph] Dreamers will preserve our nation. [paragraph] The Revolutionary War made America a dream - a fact. [paragraph] The First World War failed. [paragraph] The Second World War should make democracy - now limited - universal.

      "I think one of the armys biggest faults is its limitless red tape. To much time is lost in desk to desk moving. I personally believe that when I was found physically incapabile that I shoold have been [unclear] retorned [/unclear] so as I could secure medical help and who knows become helpful to the war effort in some other field. [paragraph] I also believe that when a man is in a organization to die for its cause if necessary that at the least he shoold be treated as a part of it. Such is not true of the army. We are tolerated and no more. Oppartunities are limit-ed, and in general the Army is not for The Negro as yet. Such handling naturally kills a mans spirit and keeps his moral down. Under the circumstances a man is only half the soldier he could be. \n",
      "I think that the army should discontinue its policy of placing white officers over otherwise all negro companies and should replace the white officers with colored men. If this is not possible, which I am sure it is, why not equalize things by placing colored officers in charge of otherwise all white companies? It appears to me that the army doubts the ability of colored leaders for some reason. Wouldn't it stand to reason that a colored officer would understand the colored man better than the white officer would and because of his better understand would produce better soldiers? Another thing I have noticed is that the army seems rather reluctant in letting any colored into the medical department. All of the general hospital units hospital train units etc. are composed of white troops. Why is this? Does the army think the colored man lacks the learning capacity of a white man? It has been proved again and again that if the colored man is given the same training and education as a white man for a particular job he can do the job just as efficiently as the white man.\n",
      "The world is changing, but too many of us are trying to [unclear] [unclear] these changes and not enough of us who can be heard the world over are defenders of the principles of Serenity. True, next to defying mankind is not of [unclear] of changes, but all things change and we [unclear] change along with them. If we profess to fight for liberalism, justice, opportunity, equality and freedom of all, then we too must put those principles into practice. That is the only way in which the people of the United States and of other nations can believe us. America is in a wonderful position to lead the world. Not by force or fear but with requests and honor. But to continue to permit & feed [unclear] of [unclear] north as well as south - to have their way will be more than a disaster to all mankind. By their conduct and actions during the last four years, why have [unclear] begun to plant the seeds for another war. We must give truth to liberalism and realism to truth . We cannot claim to be teachers when we have not yet solved similar problems in our own homeland and put into practice what we presume to preach. We need equality before the law, equality generation, equality in the economic field and equality of expression in all parts of our land and on broader integration of democracy in order that it will function to the full benefit of all the people. Let us have one human race and not our many blind divisions. There is nothing to fear, but fear itself. \n",
      "In speaking of conditions after the war, I think there will have to be quite a few changes made about this race problem, we are always talking about the constitution of the United States states this and that well why not live up to this and that. The biggest problem will be to break up such [unclear] [/unclear] which leads to everything evil. And if something isn't done about this now and quick this place will not be fit to live in after the [deletion] [/deletion] war\n",
      "I think the Army is a swell place, and since Ive [I've] been here Ive [I've] enjoyed it. But the organization I am in how is lousy. The officers leans to race Problems. The Bn. Commander doesnt [doesn't] seem to trust his N.C.O.s. Every time a detail goes out there must be a [an] officer, I think its [it's] no need for that for it makes a NCO lag on his job, for no one have confedence [confidence] in him. This outfit is run more like a CCC Camp than the Army, when I first Came into the Army a NCO. was a [an] important man, but now if given a job to do he must be followed and hounded by the Bn. Commander & the whole staff. They cry about Morale well the officers keeps down the Morale of this outfit for instance if a soldier gets caught for curfew or is a day late returning from furlough which happens quite often due to transportation facilities where we are now stationed. Well No one investigates as far as my part I don't have to much trouble but I sees plenty being done to other thats [that's] unneccessary [unnecessary] . I am having my opinion on experience of the 4 years being in the Army. I've seen men be punished for carrying their troubles to the Inspecting general, at one Inspection the Bn Commander had all batteries marched to the woods until the inspection General left.\n",
      "I think conditions will be kind of rough after the war. War is costing a lot o' money. But after 3 or 4 years things should improve. And I hope that as long as there's breath in my body I'll never have to enter nobody's army. After the war I feel there's going to be a lot of race riots but I hope not. I hope we won't have to organize an army to prevent it.\n",
      "All I can say the Army needs to learn how to deal with its men. Politics in the army still prevails. Equality has yet to be achieved which is the essential part of a good army. Play fair with the soldiers of the VS and you will have good supporting citizen always. Most of the soldiers have not been treated fair. It is useless to even ask a soldier how he feels about his treatment in the army. Yes it is true a few have had a long time in the army but most of us has caught. Well not much credit for an army like that. Where is that democracy we soldiers have been hearing about. I hope we will find it after this war. We have not seen if some one have been in the army. I would like to say more but I may appear as being nondis?? to a certain bunch of army politicians. Never the less lets get together and give the soldiers a better break after the war. Don't let it be 20 years later.\n",
      "After the war the men who have been in the war should be given the jobs that they want. They shouldn't be as hard on the men as they are, give the sick men a help. Let a man go home and marry if he wants too. \n",
      "I still feel that I will meet some opposition after war. Due to racial inequalities. Especially in my feel. In as much as I have been limited as much in the army as I have been in civilian life No provisions were made to give certain groups their proper outlet.\n",
      "Well I tell you I will be glad when this war is over. So I can get out and make some money. Because a private in the Army isn't get enought [enough] money to keep his cloth [clothes] cleans [clean] . And his toilets articel [article] . While the civilian out side making a load of money. So by that I no [know] my condition will be bad after the war is over. I will have to go right to work.\n",
      "[deletion] Nothing [/deletion] . After the war is over these white folks they are going to do these negroes the same way as before the war. I hope some changes will be made because we have much rights no way. Because they do what they want to do. Our voice don't mean a thing because things will go as they want them.\n",
      "I think the army should some consideration to the type of white officers thats placed over colored troops. There some officer who's never been around Negro before and don't know or either don't care how they treat them. [para] Also in some camps if they have to have segregation have some kind of entertainment and transpotation to Negro soldiers to nearby towns or cities where they can find relaxation. [para] I think the [unclear] Felc [/unclear] should make it they're duty to see to it that Negro soldier get jobs that measure up to they're ability. And that the old American policy of last hired and first fired isn't continued.\n",
      "The morale of a soldier is very important and being discriminated certainly does not help if anything it hinders. If Negro soldiers are good enough to fight and die along side of his white comrades, he is also good enough to reap some of the better opportunities in life, such as equal opportunities for jobs and equal transportation rights. With out a doubt they are the things Negroes want most.\n",
      "The Army itself is OK, but the policies that the Army officers use are dam poor. For instance the segregation that is used in army posts and camps are ridiculous, we as negro soldiers are humiliated every time we get on a bus or try to go to a theatre on the post, and not even allowed to enter a post exchange that serves the white soldiers. Are we suppose to be fighting for America or against America? What kind of a moral [morale] do you expect us to have living under the conditions that confront us now? We are suppose to be fighting for the very things that Hitler, [unclear] [/unclear] , [unclear] [/unclear] , and Sparks stand for. Can't the U.S. Government do something about all this? How about it?\n",
      "I checked #B in question #[unclear] 64 [/unclear] because I think that after the war People who are now being forced to hire members of my race will discharged them by the thousands. I don't think that FEPC will have any authority after the was to make the employers retain their negro help. Therefore I think that unless Uncle Sam start to take steps now his Negro nephews will have a hard time securing a job after the war\n",
      "The army like every other branch of the Armed Forces gives very few Negroes a chance to do what he wanted to do. The army takes a negro and puts him right in the WM or any other service that does slave work. I know a lot of capable young men who hate the army because some dumb Non-Com officer is over them. I would work in a defence for nothing if I could get out of the Army. My moral has been way down ever since I've been in. There nothing in here that interests me. I wish I could die get killed or get discharged so I could forget about the time I've put in.\n",
      "I really understand why every man doesn't get his chance in the army. That is because the army doesn't take them unless they are mentally qualified and secondly we have just experienced this huge army for the first time in history. Therefore we or I expect [unclear] [/unclear] mistakes but as a whole it is being handled very fair & the best of military and ability. And I am for at least one year's training for young men after the war, and they can be corrected by the mistakes made in the past years of them or this present war. Because I personally believed & have study history which shows, we & the world to have one just about every 20 years. Therefore I will be old then & won't have to do what my parents are doing today. Let the Army take care of the next war but pray we don't have one. Jesse C. Gibson 33638911\n",
      "I want to say that the Negro soldiers after the war should be given the same benefits as the white soldiers receive. We have done our part as well as they have and even thought the treatment that we receive won't be on par as that that the white boys will receive, I still feel that this country as a whole should accord them everything that a soldier should get. [paragraph] I have had letters from my friends white and colored inviting me back to offer my services as an instructor in music - I am one of the fortunate ones. But I'm wondering if the many other Negro boys will be welcomed like that. I hope our country as a whole is big enough to overlook the color barrier and trust our servicemen not as a white or colored soldier -- but as a true American soldier as a whole. \n",
      "to begin with, I am a Negro Soldier. At present my outfit is preparing for overseas movement. O.K. Now here is what puzzles me. I am [unclear] [/unclear] there is only 2 places on the post for Negroes to go to the show, + 2 Post Exchanges for the Negroes. Due to the fact that there is discrimination in civilian life, why is it that we the Negro Soldier as a whole have to put up with it in the Army where all men are considered equal? When we get overseas, color is going to be forgotten. Perhaps we will all fight together on the Battlefield, but here in garrison we are discriminated. I really can't see any sense in having Negro Soldiers if they can't be treated no better than we are at present. It puts me to question some of the training films I've seen since I've been in the Army, \"What Are we fight for.\" I often wonder, what is the Negro Soldier fighting for, because right now, as far as I can see, I would say NOTHING.\n",
      "The only comment I have is this: I have found that the Army makes a big mistake in leading its northern boys to Southern camps. It is quite obvious, that the Southern boys in the Service resents the northern boy and vice versa therefore there will always be that constant friction between the two. I also believe that White Officers resent commanding negro troops and a lot of negro troops resent White Officers. Why not have negro troops commanded by Negro Officers, the same for the White soldiers. Give them their very people to command them. Once that feeling of prejudiceness and Race Hatred is broken down I feel quite confident that the whole country as a whole will be a better place to live in.\n",
      "Going to return to the North as soon as possible. First time in the South & the last. Treatment was very bad. Freedom & democracy lacking. Made Army life dull & worthless. It is hoped that citizens of this section realize the sacrifices of time wasted to make democracy live. Practice what is preached. Find the many of the Officers now in Ogm to be from the South with superior attitudes. Don't mind insulting a soldier. Calling ??men boys 7 Oscd. They think colored soldiers as all dumb, lacking stable minds. Been at my works 3 years & here is a new officer formerly in Plat trying to tell me my job.\n",
      "I sure hope negroes get a better chance after this war because we have did a very important part in help winning it and we won't have to go home and be denied the same privilege as a white soldier and I do hope we will get a chance to bring some of those Bastards in the south to justice that kills negroes and think nothing of it. One thing I am almost positive of and that is if a negro get his equal rights the people of the world will see how we will go to the top and equal any race on God's green earth.\n",
      "I think the sough should be like the north. I will never visit the south or the south west after the war. They are nowehere, especially Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Loisiana, Texas and many others. I find that in the Army through out the south & southwest, the Jim Crow still in full swing. Personally where I came from, people are more sensible. I think that its silly and dumb founded. As a soldier of [unclear] fleet [/unclear] I find that their are separation acts pull here on the post. Colored boy do not have it as comfortable or any where near as the whites. Yes, we gave up our homes, our families, our pleasures for what Texas Texas [unclear] dam Texas [/unclear] and all it stand for. Negro soldiers are not allowed to attend all War Department Theatre here in Camp Hood. It is against the standard of my personel dignity to tell such a lie and say I am having a fine time here in Texas.\n",
      "The conditions after the war will be tough. In my opinion the Gov't should not only promise but make it a fact that ex servicemen will be more or his provided for after this is over. Personally I haven't got to much confidence in the promises made and believe that we will actually have a harder time then than we could ever have now. I can take anything that is handed to me now but I will need plenty of help in he future. I wonder if I will be able to get it? [paragraph]\n",
      "I don't know exactly, but my idea is that it seems to me if an enlisted man in the army had a course which he was very much interested in there should be some way for him to go to school and be prepared for duty after the war, therefore it would not be as much time wasted by waiting until after the war to go to school as it would be to go now. As you know everybody have their own ideas about a thing, but a man would be much more interisted if he was studying for what he longed to be.\n",
      "I think the Army does not place a man in the right field that he belongs in, they tell you that they will and then they do something else. I have had some very heart breaking moments since I have been in the army. I feel that all of my previous education [deletion] didn't [/deletion] did me very much good.

      "I am certainly not in accord with the U.S.A. Army having segregation policys. I think we are fighting a war to [unclear] [/unclear] race and class discrimination. I think the army should be the first unit to abolish such policys. I certainly am not in accord with the treatment the Negro service man is receiving in the South. I only pray to god that I am not sent to an area where such harsh policys are practiced, ecause certainly I think it silly to fight for a cause abroad and let the same thing exist right here at home, believe me. I know what I am talking about because I was born and raised in the south and that's why I have spent the past five years in the north, because I certainly do not approve of these tactics in a so called Democratic State? I often wonder why we fight Facisism, Nazisism abroad and let the same exist right here in our own country, right in Washington State capital. Certainly I really don't believe the Negros are going to stand such punishment after the war. Certainly after I fight in the jungles and deserts I am going to want the same freedom and liberty as any other citizen to vote, for jobs and certainly to be able to live as others.\n",

Personal + thing that sucks your that have been is the service of the U.S. for a deal of time should get the best when even they are dismiss from the Army. A lot of men have married since they been in the army and have wife and family and don't have any home so I do believed it is the government duty to see that every man that has served in the U.S army is titled to a good farm\n",
      "The Negro citizen entertains graver doubts than ever before about eventual reward for contributions to American development. In general the treatment accorded Negro men and women in the services has been far short of what one would expect in a great \"democracy\". This treatment is resented by him and causes him much concern. He asks himself who are my real enemies and needs to turn only to the majority of white America for the answer. The Negro civilian is still fight for a chance to employ his talents usefully in business, industry, agriculture unmolested by the barriers of race discrimination and prejudice, segregation and animosity. Negro America know that it will have to fight a fight for equality of opportunity here in his native land. The acceptance by the armed forces of the Southern pattern of discrimination & segregation was one of the greatest blows democracy here or anywhere has received. When the social policies of one bigoted section of the country can be imposed on the remainder, race minorities can justifiably entertain doubts about peaceful solution of their problems. \n",

      "I think the United States should keep a standing army after this war much longer than the pre Pearl Harbor Army as we would be much better prepared for future wars if there be any. I would like to have better conditions or understanding between the Colored and White races in the United States especially in the Southern States. Give us a chance to vote, equal rights, social equality. As for the war I think we are doing a good job of it, was a little late starting but production and manufacturing of war materials is at top peak, and man power no limit.\n",
      "We all know that there will be a depression shortly after the war so the soldier will catch hell as far as money is concerned. The civilian working now are making big money & trying harder to keep them over the fall of the depression but the soldier won't have anything hardly to keep him going so if the Army could see fit to turn some of us loose it would do a lot of good. Most soldiers are going to rest after the war and when they do go back to their old employment they won't be able to get their job back. The set up of the whole wide war machine could be straightened out. The discharge nation problem is getting worse instead of better. The Italian prisoners have more privileges than most of our soldiers and they ask ?? is our morale is high. We ask ourselves what in the hell are we fighting for. we are discriminated from every ?? they that state and then the Army have enough nerve to ask if we aren't get a fair deal or a fair break. Well the answer is hell knows and the sooner we are out the better we will all be.\n",
      "Must admit my association with the Army has awakened [unclear] [/unclear] [unclear] [/unclear] A life, driving force, frankness and in all added many qualities. And in exchange for time lost, feel duly compensated. [paragraph] On returning to civilian life want to see a more standarized world as far as recieving credit for \"producing\" - would love to see less \"Double Standard' of Democracy and less commercialism. Think I would like to see a U.S. where every man and woman is guaranteed a \"Place in the Sun in return for hard work - no matter which field is chosen. Let Economic Freedom Ring. - .\n",
      "I think the conditions would be better after the war is to let the family men return home as possible so as to hold families together. A man with a family needs to be with them and let the single men serve in the Army as it would be much better for them Because they could make better soldiers than married men because they are more alert. I could do mroe for my country at home better than I can here as my age is against me. my family needs me and I need them.\n",
      "I think negroes should have abetter chance to live like people. An abetter chance to get a job because they are playing a great part in this war 2 to prove that this is part of their country. And they like to have a much better country to come back to than they had before they left.\n",
      "I do think colored soldiers should be given more chances at more [unclear] variety [/unclear] of jobs than before. For certain States cannot allow them to join the Unions therefore lots of children do not [unclear] [/unclear] up certain jobs for there [unclear] [/unclear] [unclear] [/unclear] [unclear] [/unclear] to them in earning [unclear] [/unclear] likely [unclear] [/unclear] . So in case of a war emergency help is very hard to get because it is only one Race to get them from.\n",
      "None other than this, will the service men coming out of the Army & Navy after the war is over have a chance to go back to their old jobs and not made to wait or look for jobs. [paragraph] The Government should try to place all service men in job best suited for service men after the war. [paragraph] \n",
      "I think that conditions for the colored races will be worse after this war, because it is getting worse already. The reason I say this is because everything is Jim Crowed and the colored man didn't have any chance in the army, so you know that he won't have any chance out of the army.\n",
      "The army does quite a bit for some & others it almost reck their lives. Those who can make their self contented with almost anything have no ambition about them self, it does nothing. there are many thing one can lean in the army that will help him in civilian live, but everyone don't get the same breaks. The army has many fault that also go along with it good ones - for instant segeration on army posts The Negroes are usually kept in the South until they are sent across sea. And their is no place for the Negro below the Mason Dixon line. It hard to believe even on army post they are usually segerated. To the extent where they have no amusement at all. I know that are set aside for them are like hat boxes. If we are fight for the Four Freedoms why shouldn't we all be treated alike under the Bill of right. \n",
      "I have little respect for an Army or those who run it that refuses to or cannot protect its Enlisted & Officer personnel of [underline] Color[underline] the same as White personnel. By protect I mean see to it they are treated like a soldier or man in his own U.S.A. There are incidents on record where Prisoners of [unclear] War [/unclear] have been accorded better treatment than negro soldiers. I was told when I came into the Army \"I was a paid killer\". I believe it and would like to kill not only Germans but those who were born in American whom deny citizens of color their rights. The thing the Allies are fighting against. The negro soldier is fighting and helping the white to protect in this country. Any act committed by Hitler has been and still is being used against the Negro Soldiers & civilian here in the U.S.A. The whole business of democracy is a joke as I see and know it. I hope before this war is over all enemies of democracy in its truest sense will be blasted to bits and their offsprings exterminated!\n",
      "The Army should be more candid about who they comission. I think an enlisted man gets a fairly rotten deal when something happens between him and an officer and neither of them has a witness. As a rule the officers word is taken rather than the enlisted mans word and that shouldnt be. It is tru that an officer is supposed to be a gentleman that is after he is comissioned but actually the bars on his shoulder does not change his character. If he was rotten or no good before he came in the Army and has been that way all his life he will continue to be that way until he dies. Any soldier (enlisted man), regardless of his rank will do his very best to preserve disciplines when he has good square shooting leaders but the stuff thats in [insertion] him [/insertion] which would be of the greatest benefit to the Army just wont come out when there is partiality in his organization. signed: a colored [underline] Soldier [/underline] P.S. Please consider this for the sake of a better army\n",
      "Well I don't like the army especialy down here in the South. I don't see why they have to [unclear] see [/unclear] men from other states to this place. I think they can train them just as well where they were when they were drafted.\n",
      "In the army I am told that there is no discrimination. But I have personally found that discrimination and segregation are both rampant. We are supposted to be fighting for democracy, but I have found that democracy is not practised at home. Officers in many instances are responsible for many sets of prejudices which lead to discrimination and segregation. Lynchings and other brutal acts are perpetrated against members of the armed forces of the U.S., and these acts seem to go unnoticed. Why? Is it because they are carried out on members of a minority group? If these acts continue, and no effort is made to stop them, how can we set an example for the world to follow?Let us as an \"ideal\" nation stamp out the things tshat are rendering us apart and build a country that is truly \"ideal\" in every sense of the word.\n",
      "Conditions in the United States after the war I think are going to be rather puzzling to me and a lot of folk due mostly to the large amount of people who have moved from one section of the country to manufacturing centers and may decide to stay. [paragraph] The standard of living of most migrant workers has been raised and will cause much hardship if are forced back into old [unclear] wedge [/unclear] levels, their attitude toward other racial groups will be much worse if a depression should strike. [paragraph] Also think immigration records should be made compulsory after the war covering any disease that one can be protected from in advance. The VD program should be given preference.\n",
      "I don't think that we get the food that we should get here in this outfit. I don't think they give you enough time off, they keep you confined to duty too often I don't think the soldiers have enough recreation. You don't get a leave like you should get in this camp here. Personally I think my transfer from the Air Corp to a post Co. was a rotten deal. I like my previous camp much better than this one. You are treated more like a soldier. There they would give us some kind of entertainment ever so often. Things of that sort makes you feel more like being in the army. Where they [unclear] desire [/unclear] you & continually keep you on duty makes you feel as if you are not a human. [paragraph] \n",
      "The army has a bad practice of giving narrow minded , prejudice minded, seemly unintelligent men authorities that as the one thing that has caused some very miserable times for a lot of fellows, being commanded by persons who just don't understand other humans by men who uses army regulations to hide behind in carrying out their cruelties for instance my Brig. Commander and group commander, Col Charles E. Boyle, Lt. Col. H. K. Baker. I do sincerely hope that living conditions be on an equal basis for all as well as social conditions. I hope that educational facilities be equally provided for all concerned an [and] summing I hope that people all over these United States be given equal rights.\n",
      "I think that the Negro should be given equal rights because that is what we are supposed to be fighting for. As it is we are not much better than our enemy. As far as \"Democracy\" is concerned, \"All men are created equal\" a passage from The Bible. Of course this is susposed to be a religious country. As far as jobs, A man should be choosen by his ability and not his country. We are born the same way and die the same way. Why not let people live the same way. I am not a Negro but have common sense enough to know that they do not get half a fair chance and that there is no such thing as White Supremacy. Why didn't they pass the Anti-Lynch Bill. It was because it was to the negro's advantage.\n",
      "I would like to have social equality. I think it would be a better place to live if we be social equality. I think everyone should be given an equal break. There are plenty of jobs we could handle but we don't ever get a chance. In most states the only job we can get is porter work or ???. Some think that other ??? would& take where they couldn't find anything else at the present. If we are trained for a job I think we should be able to get it regardless of race.\n",
      "The Army is a fine thing to be in, but the army fault I have is the rules concerning the treatment of soldiers are never practiced in most cases. We all are in the Army and suppose to be as one United Nation's Army. Bur are We? Is the Army Jim Crowed? If a man is a man in the Army, why are there reserved seats for (white) enlisted men in the following facilities? Theatres, houses, [unclear] [/unclear] restaurant. service clubs and many others? Regardless of the price, after the war, I shall demand my right, not only for myself, but for my race as a whole. After all, everyone has a feeling.\n",

Service men have had wonder-ful opportunities if they wanted them, trades and schools of all types were and are till open to any soldier that want to learn. So far as my plans are concerned a few minutes won't start to tell a complete story. They are so many. I was in school before intering into active service and when I finish school then I can tell just how my plans will be. I may have to do a little replanning.\n",
      "I am not glad to be in the army but nor was I glad to go to work each morning in civilian life. In my opinion I entered the army as a sacred duty a duty that I vowed to perform with the best of my ability - I still have that idea in mind and although I would accept an honorable discharge this minute, I challenge anyone to try to beat me in my obligations as a soldier. In reference to the G.I. bill I think that's the best thing that could happen to us G.I's.\n",
      "As a man who is fighting for his country I do resent the manner in which I'm being treated down here in the south. I believe as Abraham Lincoln believes, all men are created equal. I do resent the [unclear] [/unclear] Jim Crow system, all discrimination and other injustices that I, and fellow soldiers and all other colored people are subjected to. Though I'm patriotic (I volunteered) I sometimes ask myself why should I be so eager to fight for a country in which 1/2 its people[insertion] (the south) [/insertion] do not appreciate me and my kind.

      "My only comment is that after we have so proudly given our blood for a just & [unclear] Ourning [/unclear] peace that those who's job it is to prepare the same will do an equally job so that our [unclear] [/unclear] children in the generations to come will not be engaged in another war because the peacemakers of this one were to selfish or blind or incably of taking charge of a victory that was paid for by blood & tear.

Even the honorable sec. of war has been quoted as saying that we are only fit for service units and has forthwith proceeded to put Negroes there. If indeed our presences are so distasteful in the army then why not just start a mass discharge movement. Moreover, after about two years of service in the army, I have not as yet been able to see any traces of what I am supposed to be fighting for: \"Democracy\" I have heard long winded definitions on what it is supposed to be, but as yet, I haven't seen any part of it yet.\n",
      "I think that the goal we are fighting for should be in???: after a pattern that Russia has found in her way of thinking (A) Capital Punishment for all offenders of racial discrimination if necessary. The soldiers are fighting now against a vicious enemy for that reason today. (2) Thinking that one race has the right to be better than another there will always be conflict. This thing can be eased if steps are taken. There is still evidence of certain branches of the Army refusing persons if other races a chance to give them service (Nurses) Lately a few have been taken but the percentage is still very small.\n",

Just think, 6,000 people (white) goes on strike, an have a race riot. be-cause a few Negros get a better job in some transit co. that's why I am undecided about my post war job. if their is one for me, I suppose I'll starve for a while (me & family) be-cause they'll give all the job that opened to the opposite race first an we'll be last. an it won't be any left. their are over 13,000,000 of [insertion] American [/insertion] negros in this country. Any body else gets along better than we do. I don't suppose the American (white) [unclear] we [/unclear] heard of an incident happen to some men in uniform, somewhere in Texas a while back.

With the so call democracy the negro should waste no time fighting in Europe but insted fight in the USA against exploitation and lies told by the white race. No Negro troops should fight Japan which is a colored race. We are being forced to help the white race dominate the world races. Justice and liberty can be given us just as lazy as it can be given to the people of the lands owned by the USA. Important bills that will be of value to the negro race is always avoided by the government, however ?? a bill to aid China, make them citizens and even help all races but the negro race - why? The problem of the Jewish people has been given consideration by the allies but never the problem of the negro of the USA- Why? We have fought in two wars and the third no doubt is at hand if the present form of government continue.\n",

The army really builds a person up & would be alright for a lot of people who just like to travel.

I may be wrong but I have that feeling. such thing[s] as equal, why that don't even touch the colored man but may be after the war is over may be things may be will be better, but I have feeling that it's going to be the same as world war (1). untill [until] thing's has change.

Also, they put people over us who were [unclear] borned [/unclear] and raised in the south. Who hate you because you are in the same camp as them. Why don't stop and think that when our boys are across the pond. Bullets stop and look at you to see what color you are. They let prisoners of war eat any place they want.

      "I will say this much that german & italian prisoners of war, are treated better than the negro soldier, and after this war a great percentage of them will be given citizen ship papers and be given jobs, bosses over not only us, but also other Americans that have fought to anialate [annihilate] the very guy that holds the job that he'd be called crazy to even think about. It really hurts my heart to know of instances where the negro or [underlined] american [underlined] soldiers was refused to be served a meal in the many same restaraunt that german prisoners of war had been given the best of service, why? Just the Damn prejudice hearted, narrow minded crackers cant [can't] stand to see a negro doing half way decent.\n",

      "The negro in my opinion has not gotten a fair deal in the Army. The Army directive stating there would be no descremination [discrimination] in the military forces has been disregarded on a large scale, exceedingly true in Southern States. [paragraph] The majority of Negroes troops who train on this side, as do combat unit, in most instances are connected to some labor outfit before going overseas. I think if the Negro soldier is give the same type of training as white troops, in lieu of devoting so much time to policing the area etc he would know more about the techniques of actual fighting\n",

      "Well to explain myself as clearly as possible. I was born in the south (Ga.) Right now I am serving in the armed forces and am pretty displeased with the attitude of the white race to the negros. I am a negro so if I am to continue living in this country I would demand equal rights. I am now training to fight the eniemy but from incidents that have occurred to take direct effects upon me, I will gladly stand ready to oppose the systems of democracy. The city of which I was a native, has revealed some of the most inhumane occurrences to man and again I say that I will go as far as killing the opposers of equal rights among the different races in this country. Unless the leaders of Democracy can enforce its own laws, I am forced to say that it is a fraud.\n",
      "As any negro soldier should think I think we all have been treated unfair, the army doesn't change a bit when it comes to Jim Crow etc. Down in the south which I've been stationed most of my army life, is really bad on a negro soldier. Even if we weren't to be treated on equal [unclear] bases [/unclear] as the white soldier they should respect the uniform if not the race, but there's no reason why we can't all be treated alike. In fighting zones no bullets are marked Black or White, when blood is shed from any soldier it does not run out white or black but red all alike but that is not the only reason there are many reasons. When God created men he created them alike lets be treated alike we are all men not fools and tools let's make it proud to be Americans.\n",
      "The Army hasn't given the men in my unit a fair break. Recreation and section of the country very unsatisfactory (South).

Others [unclear] having [/unclear] my unit were placed correctly but their ratings and experiences were much lower than mine. Our officers are not giving the men square deals. Majority of unit are now trying to get transfers to other units. Instead of having the good will of them they have bad will and men can not soldier under these conditions.

      "The war should have broken up most of the discrimination in the states by now. The government should stick to the Constitution rather than use so much of a one man theory. Servicemen should be allowed far more opportunity than they were after the last war.

Bilbo and a number of others should be cautious about what they say.\n",
      "Believe or rather hope conditions in the U.S. will be better after the war then before the war. I think justice should be better for us after the war because of our part in this war.

Statement of charges should be eliminated at least for articles ? under ten dollars. The war just hope it will soon be over.\n",

Eat better food in the mess halls and anytime they want it. The army put men over soldiers - who even hate them from the start Yes I am a colored soldier. All my officers are from the south and I hate them just as much as they hate me. Instead of the army helping this matter - it seems to me that they are trying to make matters worse The white soldiers can mix with any race, but we can't mix with any dark races still we have the best morale, do the best work and still manage to improve ourselves. We know we don't have a even chance, so when we are shot in the back by civilians, giving them deals, giving long army court martial-we still are going to get what is due us - maybe soon or compell it after the war is over. I hate to think what some of the things that will happen if not, but in whole we are fighting for our country and trying to do our part. Hoping to make a better world not only for the white but also for the dark races. We can't loose. \n",

Many won't be able to [unclear] dry [/unclear] out their plans, and should be helped in any way possible. Men with families will have much more reponibilitys [responsibilities] , and should be among the first to be let out of service. I also feel that we should keep a force so strong and well trained that no other nation will dare to attack us. We must start on these plans now and not wait until the war is over, because it is our way to forget as soon as the danger has passed. [paragraph] \n",
      "I think the army would do well to put forth greater effort in \"putting round men in round holes\" and keeping \"squares\" in their places.

Conditions among the armed service now are of such that one must debate whether it is easier to fight for a mythical democracy overseas or die for the real thing here & now. There is no promise that the situation will improve. It will be a sad state of affairs in these United States when the members of our negro troops who waded through blood & death return to the Jim Crowism of his homeland. -Finis- \n",

It is pretty hard to take things from people who think they are really better than others.

      "Better education among the younger generation - especially the negroes living in the country and smaller towns - is especially needed. Trade schools should be available to them. Through a better education amoung all classes the segregation + Jim Crow that is so widely praticed now will be greatly decreased. Continued military training is vital for the country and the young me in it.\n",
      "Why give the same survey to negro soldiers that [deletion] [/deletion] is given to white soldiers when it is a known fact that the economic, political, & citizenship rights of the two races are different.

      "After the war is over I was wondering if the Southern Negro or the Negro in general will have a better chance for advancement after the war and that he'll be treated with respect due any person of the human race. Especially in the south we Negroes will have liberty and justice. When the war is over, I think there should be a plan drawn up whereas a man after having been in service and served as best he could be considered by being helped to get back on his feet. By getting on his feet, I mean Help him build and get a decent job. This tends to elevate the standards of the country.\n",

I believe that there is enough in this country for all of us but there has been no concerted effort of the thinking people of the U.S. to make us feel that we are all striving toward a common goal. On the contrary, there has been too much work done to divide group vs group, race vs race, color vs color, religion vs religion & section vs section. The solution lies in more education, less propaganda & a greater effort of all of us to know the other fellow's problems & to help him solve them, thus helping ourselves.\n",

As I served before I am a native of the United States, but am not treated as such, I'm hoping the time will come when we at home practice our teaching & stop worring of how to annoy the minority groups. We must stop segregation & give every one a fair play regardless of creed. [paragraph] \n",

Not only in cities but even in camps, [deletion] [/deletion] there too much segregation. It would be stopped on military reservations if the higher up wanted to stop it, but they don't seem like they do. The white troops have facilities which should be given to all U.S. troops but isn't. In this camp a negro soldier cannot make a phone call after ten o'clock P.M. no matter how important it is. They have a regular phone system set up but the colored cannot use it. There is not supposed to be any segregation in the U.S. Army but there is and no body seems to care. Sooner or later there will be some changes made one way or the other. The boys are getting tired of it. We all fighting like any other soldier and it is a god dam [damn] shame that some people can let such conditions exist & call this a democracy.\n",

With this security in mind, I am also hoping the democracy I left will be a better democracy than that I see now. The Constitution alone can not guarantee a true democracy, nor can a government survive unscarred while corrupt political forces continue to distort the power granted them. We human beings are begging for a chance to show we are human beings. Until such a time when we can enjoy the satisfaction of knowing we are subject to the same provisions of democracy as our \"brothers\" then the [deletion] [/deletion] [unclear] [/unclear] Bill of Rights, or any bill of rights will make very little difference.\n",

Why! I don't know But I do think it being unfair.

      "After the war is over I think that it will be worse for the Negro because everyday all indications point to it. We as colored soldiers find more prejudice and have more conflicts here in the U.S. army than we had in civilian life. If we have such trouble here in the army we expect to have more after we are out of the army. There are also certain branches of the service that we as free Americans are denied the privilege of being in. It seems that the army officials try to put the Negroes in certain branches of the service, mostly labor outfits, and that's true, so we can expect to find it worse after the army but we'll fight for our rights.\n",
      "Well the govt. will have to -- must enforce the principles for what we are righting fore, at home in the U.S.A. as well in foreign countries. All must think of its minorities, they are definitely a part of America, in other words the minorities have to seek a double victory, at ab home as well as abroad. The South will have to realize this,as it has no respect for minority officers or soldiers they are treated worse than prisoners of war here are treated. We want to live the principles we are fighting for, we too are Americans giving our life & blood.\n",
      "The Subject of Equality both Political and economic for all U.S. citizens regardless of race, creed or color is constantly on my mind and frankly I think very little is being done to protect minorities now or provide for their future. The wanton discriminatory acts of cruelty and injustice heaped on the families of American Soldiers (Negro) and even sometimes on soldiers themselves makes the spirit of the Negro very low indeed. It is impossible to have good spirit and be willing to give all for a cause that you and your family will not have the priviledge of enjoying. The obvious indifference, hypocrisy, injustice and race baiting by our \"Honorable\" public officials from the south simply infuriates me. The placing of obviously inferior men in positions of authority over more competent men because of color or race is rampant in the Armed forces (another cause of frustrated anger and low spirits). We are fighting (we are told) to give liberty and freedom to all people. This is the exact opposite of the truth in the case of the American Negro. Many criminals are simply proud men who refuse to bow to \"Jim Crow.\" I hate Hitler, and all he stands for but there are those among us who advocate the same principles of a so called \"Master Race\" right here in the United States, \"the champion of suppressed people.\" I think strong, positive measures should be taken to protect all minorities and assure them of what the Constitution is supposed to give them. There should be at least a glimmer of light to keep hopes and ideals alive. Political and Economic equality are the things most desired by the minorities - I can speak for America's largest, the Negro.\n",
      "Concerning conditions in the United States after the war. I think the government should be more democratic in employing workers. I think they should be chosen according to their qualifications regardless to their race, creed or color. Segregation not tolerated. More laws should be passed demanding the rights of all citizens. Every person that desire to further his education be given a fair chance, especially those that spent one year or more in the Armed Services.\n",

He is not physically capable of withstanding the necessary hardships. His mind is constantly directed to his family - because that is where his heart lives (assuming he is satisfactorily married) Due to this mental diversion, he is not not capable of doing a totally effective job.

We today have German and Italian prisioner treated better than the average colored soldier, we have negro soldier today not knowing what they are fighting for, but yet they give their [underline] Lives [/underline] for freedoms which they hope whether you are white - Black Brown or Yellow that there will always be [underline] Freedom. [/underline] \n",
      "I think all this states right business is aimed at keeping the Negro down. I also feel that our government could do a heck of a lot more on the race problem than they are doing.[paragraph] If the Southern cracker was taken out of control of the U.S. Army it couldn't be quite so horrible.\n",
      "This war, so they tell us, is being fought for democracy and equality for all. It's a shame that in this army which is supposed to be fighting for \"democracy\" there is so much race hatred and discrimination. A Negro soldier, while in the uniform of the U.S. Army and fighting for his country, must put up with all kinds of insults from civilians and other members of the armed forces. This doesn't give a man very much to fight for. Democracy whould start at home. The Negro soldier has more to fight for on the home front than \"over there\". Race discrimination should not have any place in this so called democratic country - but least of all in the army.\n",
      "The army is supposed to be made up of the men of the U.S. These men are to get the same rights under the constitution of the U.S. but being here in the South for the last twelve months has changed my view point about the equality of all race in the army. The negro is counted less here in the South than our enemy. I have often wondered about such. We are fighting for the same thing. Why not be treated like we are one of the arm [armed] forces instead of being kicked about like dogs & cats. [?] I will not say any more, because when I think of the subject it makes my blood [deletion] [/deletion] run hot. [paragraph] The main question in my mind is Will the negro have a chance or will it be like the last war [?] If so there is no need of the negro being in the army. We can die for the country, but the ones that are left will have to suffer as they have always. Now I ask is this a [an] army of race [insertion] & color [/insertion] or the army of U.S.A. [?] \n",
      "I think there is too much color bar or discrimination according to one's color when all men are dying in this war, regardless of their color. After the war there are some races who will not be satisfied with being put on the back line again after participating in the war. I look for a civil war in the States if there are not a lot of changes made. There are a lot of people who will not put up with the treatment they received in pre war days. \n",
      "I feel that there should be some especially trained workers in the Army that servicman can go to with their most personal problems. I realize that there are chaplains but there should be some other agency. I feel that the men in the service forces and outfits should be given recognition for their efforts as are the combat units. These men do not realize the vital importance of their contribution. They are the \"unsung heroes\"\n",
      "Minority groups in this country have sacrificed their lives in foreign theatres. The right for them to come back without fearing discriminatory practices against them to me is a vital importance. As far as the army is concerned the facilities on posts and camps are not equal which has done more to break morale than any other single thing. [paragraph] As far as the war is concerned its been conducted magnificently. [paragraph]\n",
      "I think that it should be very carefully noticed that all ex-soldiers should get an equal chance to receive the veterans aid. [paragraph] As we know it is a law that all should get the same aid. But in many parts of this country local officials will not carry out the proper thing.\n",
      "I DON'T THINK A MAN AFTER THE WAR IS OVER AND HE HAS SERVED HIS TIME SHOULD HAVE TO STAY IN THE ARMY. ACCORDING TO WHAT I HAVE READ AND HEARD THERE IS SUPPOSED NOT TAKE ANY DISCRIMINATION ANYWHERE IN THE ARMY. BUT AS I NOTICE FROM DAY TO DAY THERE IS PLENTY IN FACT JUST AS MUCH AS BEFORE THESE ORDERS WERE PUT OUT. WHY SHOULD'NT THE NEGRO SOLDIER BE AS FREE AS THE OTHER SOLDIERS THEY ARE FIGHTING FOR THE SAME REASON?\n",
      "I, as a young negro from the south, am wondering whether the negroes will be subjected to as much mal-treatment and discrimination after the war as they were before and during this war. I, as one individual, will not subject myself to it and will die fighting for those rights. I do not intend to fight and maybe sacrifice my life so that I may come and live in a predijuce [prejudiced] southland. I cannot for the life of me, see how the American white man can call this a democracy or even call this war a war to save and preserve democracy, when they do not practice it in America nor in the American army. A man cannot help adjust others until he has first adjusted himself. Why, then go into foreign countries to democratize them when you have not democratize your own. The army and especially the southland is a shining example of an undemocratic setup. I often ask myself, Why Do I Fight? \n",
      "The United States after it will have sacrificed thousands upon thousands of men to win a socalled war against tyranny, intake none in the interest of freedom, justice, and liberty, etc. It should see to it that its own people have some of those things. I have been puzzled by the hypocrisy of this Government. Which will not even protect its own soldiers against abuse by another civilian. They have been murdered, insulted and suffered some of vilent of treatment accorded to any human beings living or dead simply because of color. A Negro soldier doesn't feel so hot sweating it out on the Ledo Road when he knows when he returns what kind of treatment is going to be accorded him. Despite all of this we are giving all that we have in order to make the world fit to live [insertion] in [/insertion] . Fit for all people. No man should be denied the right to aspire as high as God will permit. Despite the war the aim in this country seems to be to keep the Negro people \n",
      "The most important thing the country should take care is to do away with all kinds of discrimination, segregation toward races, because that is what the world was supposed to be fighting for [unclear] [/unclear] because this country should above all be the one to set the example but the main reason is that if this country or the world cant see this then there will surely rise up another war but a much worse one. And it doesnt take much to see that killing each other for such a purpose doesnt make much sense when we could all work together and help each other out instead of being against each other and killing each other. So if some one doesnt wake up and see this it will surely happen. A blind man can see it [unclear] [/unclear] the United States.\n",
      "I think that all people should be given an equal opportunity in all things whether it be educational or labor and especially in the South. In doing this I feel that the majority of the Negro troops would take more interest in the service of these United States which they call their country. Because there seems to be a feeling of their liberating people when they would be under Bondage. As other nationalitys migrate to the U.S. and are given better opportunities than the Negros than have spent a life time here and never railed in arm opposition against the southern white people who would give the same Klansmen who killed of their son an equal chance in any field. And in the Army I don't think there should be any discrimination of any post Camp or station as long as the U.S. soldier is supposedly fighting for the same cause then their should be equality.\n",
      "I really think they sould put a soldier where he is best suited and where his physical conditions would allow him to serve most. I dont think the army sould require NCO without preduce. I dont thing there sould be any predice in the army which there is, quite a bit I dont think the Army sould send soldiers 3000 miles from his induction station to get training that he could get a lot closer I dont think they sould send men from the South North. Because they try and change the Northern customs to Southern customs and that couses riots between races. [paragraph] \n",
      " Will the army really effect discharges 6 months after the duration or will it insist upon a force of occupation made up of those who would rather return to civilian life? Will the duration be when the enemies sign to unconditional surrender? Will race relationships, especially between the whites & colored be bettered after this war are will the politicians and those who have not personally felt the effect of the war try to create a strain on race relationships. If that be their intention then for what is the minority race fighting for. Is the Negro to be like dumb driven cattle, fighting to help other to obtain freedom and themselves loose it. I feel some those who have faught side by side regardless of race or creed will rise in revolt for freedom must be complete even here at home if it is to mean anything. Despite the one sided treatment the Negro soldier receives, despite the segregation, he has always proved himself a good soldier and a true American. The army and the government have fallen down in that they have the ways and means to create the existing conditions but apparently not the desire.\n",
      "I feel the government should put a stop to the way negros are treated in certain parts of this country as of right now, because those boys coming back from over seas aren't going to stand for any pushing around from any of these southern crackers.

I also think that Unites States should draft young men for a certain amount of [unclear] [/unclear] training just in case another war should come about. And concerning the Governmental jobs, I think an experienced man should have chance at the jobs first of all. So I am planning to stay in the Army for as long as possible.\n",
      "The army personnel should aid all men in the armed forces to secure a job after the war is over and allow him to make as much money at his own specific job. Men will be turned down by private concerns, who have made riches from this war and will probably hired [hire] those who will work for nothing at all.

It is up to the Gov. to look out for the less fortunate soldier who fought to save the spoil of his country.\n",

Here are still some who have not been in the thick of things who still hold their petty jealousies and prejudices. A year or two under actual combat conditioning would teach them a lot.

And the 4Es should be given a chance to experience some military training etc.\n",

I daily see prisoners of war on this post treated better than the Negro troop. I truthfully believe that the Negro in the south would be no worse off under Nazi Germany or the Japs than they are now. To ask a man to die for a Democracy that does not exist as far as he's concern is as bad as any thing the Japs or Nazis have ever did.

My every effort will be directed toward recognition of the Negro for what he has accomplished in his contribution to a society which still denies him his proper status and attempts to compromise the issue of equal opportunity by shouting \"Social equality\". No intelligent Negro wants social equality - he does not have it in his own race and the Social Register proves it does not exist in the white race. \"Social Equality\" is the cry of the ignorant who are fearful that the negro, if given equal opportunity, will surpass him. This viewpoint is justifiable in a sense when it is realised that so many negroes with almost unsurpassable obstacles placed before them, due to [insertion] the [/insertion] discrimination and prejudice of these same alarmists have become world leaders in their field. I believe in equal opportunities for all peoples. I am not in this army to defend a nation which will continue to foster the principles which places the most intelligent, cultured and accomplished Negro at the mercy of the most ignorant, uncultured and shiftless white man. To that I advocate education - of both races. Prejudice is the illegitimate offspring of ignorance - and it exists within each man. This defence mechanism of prejudice which I believe to be nothing more than a manifestation of an inferiority complex which, again, is common to certain clans of both mens, will be gradually removed as generation succeeds generation, and as each man learns more of [unclear] him & more men [/unclear] , mutual respect among men will manifest itself.

An Enlisted man was insubordinated to his senior, Officer also to his senior, Enlisted man punished by a long jail term, Officers just discharge from service as Officer. That's just a small incident.\n",

I in [unclear] [/unclear] places Thay can go in the front door an we hafter go in the back door - how can a colered man fight his best when he know the german as gain to top. What he ben fighten for soldiers I am goin over sea in the next [unclear] fearen [/unclear] but I dont think it is my duty because the call and man will be treated like he was when he came back before. [paragraph]\n",
      "I wont to know the main reason what we are fighting for some of us are not properly assign and why the man suited most for a job doesnt get it. Why is it that a Elementary Student advance much further than a man with a College education. Why Suther [southern] officers get so nasty towards certain [unclear] races [/unclear] . Why is that only person from a Foreign County can come here and get much further then Colored can enjoy the best of Convient [convenience] all so go in placeses [places] that Colored are not allowed to enter. Why is the Army Jim Crowed when they are suppose to be fighting for the same thing and wearing the same uniform why it is not publish in most papers what the Colored man is actually doing in this war all is it a Secret\n",
      "Yes I think I will live in the northern states all of my life because the most of the colored people are not treated fair in the S.P. Yes the army [unclear] all wrights but it is the people in the army it is some people in the army I [unclear] that if feal fairly good then some places I dont feel too good. But I am willingly to fight until it is over but when it is over I think I would rather stay at home.\n",
      "On one respect it will be better but on a hold I actually feel depression will arise after this war as it has all others. And also speaking for the minority groups which I feel will not receive rights & jobs equally due them after this war. There will also be younger men & women trained and more able to perform a great amount of these \"Post War\" job. The service man who has been away from civilian duties will be handicapped for a while trying to adjust himself to his new environment. Because of not as much true democracy as should be in a country as ours, this will hold down the advancement of many whom wish to attain higher goals for themselves, country and community. The morale of the northern soldier is greatly lowered by the practice of the whites who believe we should under go all this discrimination, segregation and etc and then fight as soldiers which we do for a country which we love.\n",
      "If the people were drafted in the Army according to how they felt about it I would not have been in it at all. In the first place I feel that I had nothing to fight for, that I had as many or more enemies here in the States as I did out of the states. People who tell you the jobs you can have or can't have and tell other people like me to stay in their place when, in their way of thinking, people like me have no place. I think that type of person is an enemy and there are an awful lot of them in the United States. I understand that the purpose of this war was to [preserve?] the rights of a free country, But before I came into the Army I had been told that people like me had no rights + freedom by a officer of the law. Since I've been in the Army I've seen War [Prison?] enter places where I was told to go to the back. So see why I can't feel to good about risking my life to [preserve?] such, freedom [unclear] [/unclear] [exists?] in my [world?] \n",
      "I am deeply concerned as to whether the ex-service man will have the chance to return to his old job or if another one equally as eficient [efficient] could be obtained. Also if the southern Negro and not only the Southern Negro but all Negroes be treated and respected as all peoples[people] of the world should be. This way being the true Democratic Way with liberty and justice for all.\n",
      "Yes I have a few comments to make. The army for some menn does them a lot of good but for others a lot of harm. A young man, married for at least one year before or after the war started should be turned out at the earliest possible time and if still in the States, not sent overseas at this stage of the war and given an opportunity to make a new start for themselves and family. The present civilian population do not see the need for their staying on the job therefore many young servicemen would do a better job. Some of the civilians should replace the army personnel at the close of the work for this clean up program.\n",
      "There must be equal opportunities for Negroes after the war or else there will likely be a bloody revolt. In teaching white & negro [unclear] [/unclear] students and associations with fellow teachers, I have noticed all people reared in the same environment with the same amount of education, react the same. [paragraph] A man's morale is severely lowered if he feels that he has two strikes, so to speak against him, when he is in the army or anywhere else. [paragraph] Negroes are a part of the earliest American settlers. Yet immigrants came here and got good jobs because of supposedly racial superiority. [paragraph] America should be for Americans first. \n",
      "I believe that the men should be released from the Armed forces immediately after the war. Many men have spent the best years of their life in the Army I think they should be given every chance to lead a successful life upon being released. most of us Service men are not looking for handouts, merely the opportunity to suport our self and family and maintain a decent standard of life. We are looking to the various Govt Agency for the War Veteran to give us a start along the road to our return to civilian life not to maintain us.\n",
      "I feel sure the United States will be a better social place after the war. Very [much?] [/unclear] in hope it will be. Because it just won't do this time so that is the best thing for every man to look to very important.\n",
      "The army is all right But it just some of the officers in the army that make life miserable. [paragraph] Why do not give us a chance to show what we can do the Army is full of [unclear] civial [civilians] [/unclear] that is making hight [high] as 300 and 400 hundreds a month and we soldiers can't even get a promotion The government should give the Negro their right after the war. And stop some of this Jim Crow. [paragraph] The army would be fine if we Soldier could go to town when we want to. [paragraph] The condition would be fine if they have fair labor right. Make company hire all race regardless race colored or creed\n",
      "I hope things won't be like as it was in the last war, promise a lot but give nothing. I think Roosevelt should stop the discrimination in the Army and else where because he say he can't stop it but he can. I believe if a soldier fight he should be recognized as white soldiers as and like at Camp Livingston, Louisiana a [unclear] damn [/unclear] soldier has a helluva way to go. Discrimination in Louisiana is very bad. One night I was on guard and the major told me to allow no colored soldier to cross and I think that should have been all soldiers instead of Negro soldiers. If it is left with me I will bomb all parts of the south, Georgia and Kentucky and Mississippi. After his war I hope I won't have to see anymore of this lynching going on around here. That is where we are gonna have another Army of my own. I planning on having me an army of my own after war. TO ROOSEVELT: I want him to stop all of this unnecessary stuff that is going on around here.\n",
      "We the 349th F.A. Bn Are about to go overseas. Some of the fellows want to go and some of don't want to go. The reason that a great number of the fellows don't want to go is because of our Bn Com. He doesn't know his job, and ever one [everyone] knows it but there is not any way for us to get rid of him because we are enlisted me [men] . But if there is any way for you to get him out before we go over pleas [please] do so. If we go with him it will be suicide.

      "The colored swoldier is subjected to that of the white soldier and is supposely to be fighting for democracy and the submission of the [unclear] [/unclear] German and Japanese races, but, always he faces more descrimating [descrimination] and racial prejudices than any mentioned by those two races. [paragraph] He is even white crowed abused and embarrassed right on the post of which he is stationed. Some of these men were never confronted with such in civilian life. Our military heads so-called democratic leaders should try cleaning their own back yards! the colored race are not all fools and when called upon to perform as others do should also get the same consideration,\n",
      "I personally believe that the Government should make more of an allowance to discharged men when they are released from the Army, because it's going to be very hard to secure a job and all the money we can get will be a great help.\n",
      "I think after the war there will be millions of homes broke up an some equal people to be borden. an I dont think the united states is giving the colored soldiers justus. They haven given me justus. I was in the medical core to do the best I cood to help the war. But I was transferd in another unit. Whick I cant serve. I am no good there. After all I think all the people shood get save and forget wars. JESUS is able to ceep peace for us if we trust him. he is the Prince of Peace.\n",
      "It is my belief that conditions will be worse for me as a negro after the war due to the influx of Southern whites into my home state and their successful attempt to introduce their \"Southern Tradition there. As a result of this I expect to witness, and probably be involved in many minor, or perhaps even major racial uprisings. I Dont know what to expect as a civilian for even as a soldier in the army of the United States I witness and experience intimidations because of my race which are almost unbelievable. My only hope is that the govt will take steps to improve conditions for my race where the racial issue is concerned \n",
      "I don't think that some people here in the United State know that we are fighting this war or either don't seem to care where it is even. I think it shound be made more clear to these fine poeple why we should win this war & soon as possible, I know there are many people this wise has not [unclear] [/unclear] and these are the ones who seem less concerned these should be something done about them.\n",
      "As a whole the Army would be much better if they would start doing things right instead of doing things the wrong way most of the time. [paragraph] I thought the Army would set an example of equality for all but so far, all that I have seen, was nothing but Partially and Jim Crowism. [paragraph] \n",
      "I don't like my first Sargent and neither do I like my Commanding officer they are all a bunch of ??ok and don't believe in giving man a fair break. If there was some way I could get out of the army I would be home right this minute doing my ??? work and if the first sargent go overseas he won't live to tell about it especially if I go and quite a few of the other boys. If I had any idea the army was this bad I would have killed my self. First a man would do better dead than he would working all day and cutting grass or something else all night at that rate we'll never win the war!\n",
      "After the war I have been wondering as to whether every race will have equal privelege [privilege] or will discrimination still exist & I really feel that since such a sacrifice has made as far as men giving their lives a great consideration is due the race to whom they belong regardless of color.\n",
      "Well, I'd like to get of the army I don't like it worth a dam! I am wanting my time in here could be making more money I know I am not getting a square deal in here. I don't have a heart or mind to do a thing in any army. I feel just about like a man that's thrown away in this God dam Army would like to get transfered back to medics Dam the state of Louisana I don't like the way these crackers treat Negroes\n",
      "The army ruined pratactical every negro boy my age life unnecessarily. They took us out of school and brought us into the army under the same regulation that the white boy but still we were denied nearly everything that we could use after the war. Our morale has and always will be low because we cannot see why we were drafted to served our country yet the opportunity was refused us. Since I have been in the army I have been treated as bad as a dog by the white man while our enemy German, Italians, are treated like a king before my eyes. When I get back into civilian life, my problems will be to come to a finaly stage with the \"southern white\" man. My race has profit somewhat by this war, they have been trained to protect themselves and use modern weapons.\n",
      "I only hope condition will be much better in comparasion to discrimination in the U.S.A. Because [deletion] [/deletion] we all are suppose to be fighting for the same thing. If they don't be better, then we couldn't have fought for the same purpose. The Constitution states that all men shall have equal rights That one of my main objects for fighting was I had planned improving my education. I hope living conditions will be so I can proceed without failure.\n",
      "Will he have the rights and privileges as every other fellow American. To my estimation its ignorance if a man is capable or qualified. I don't think he should be lacking opportunities that my answer on that. In this war it has been proved that if a man is qualified give them the opportunity and I am quite sure that the mission be accomplished haven't you got that same ideas to and that may be the road to breaking up discrimination among races.\n",
      "Well I think that the united states should continue to train new men after the war that haven't had any military training and I also think since the men that are in now are doing such a fine job I think that the men that put up service in the army should get a fair deal by the war department and get a break in the first [unclear] [/unclear] . That's my idea\n",
      "All that I can say that if there was more harmony between the Southern White man and the negro that this country would be a dam site better off. Why not get rid of the foreign alien instead of torturing the negro and the only race in which we can boast that we have never had a negro that was a traitor to his country. Our boys are also losing their lives in proportion to their number but when he comes home and lives in the South there won't be any glory for him for he will have to start fighting all over again in order to get a few of the things that they are entitled to. I think that most every soldiers heart is set on the G.I. bill of rights so I hope that we won't be dissappointed in them.\n",
      "I think the army is a good thing. they have men fighting a trying to [unclear] helep [/unclear] the country. I think every man should do something to help win this are. I don't think they give you enough time off to go home. I don't think they give a man his proper food. His clothes are well fitted. They don't pay off like they should do it.\n",
      "It would be better for my people if men were chasen [chosen] as leaders by their capabilities, and not because of personal reason. Units and even Armies would then not be slowed down by personnel shake-ups. There is definite need for improvement in BCS's, BCS Boards, and Non-Com schools. There are far too many officers that are inferior to enlisted in their charges. This survey will show that I'm sure. A little more tolerance, and a lot less swagger will better officers of some. There is far more to it than just the insignia. The Army needs men, not dressing dummies. And if some trifles were forgotten, and the real problems attacked, ma'd he more progressive. We have too many parades and ot enough schooling. in res militaris (military science). \n",
      "It is contrary to proper reasoning to believe men are expected to be enthusiastic about recovering lost privileges for Europeans, when the same things are denied them in their own country because they belong to a minority group. The Army, lost most of the other agencies of a supposedly democratic government, is extremely blind to the discriminations and indignities practiced within itself. It takes money and men, throws both into an orientation program to tell us why we fight for all the virtues of democracy, then almost makes us want to fight among ourselves because it refuses to practice what it preaches. Any unit that has the access to so many young minds, and doesn't try to impress them, by actual practice, the good of democracy, is failing in its duty to the country. \n",
      "Personally I think that All Service me should Be given the first chance. At the job they want. If they cant get that job I think the Govement [Government] should see that they get a job that pay them a high saluery [salary] . And men wanting to By homes I thinks some way should be made for them to by them from the Govement [Government] (on a credit.) Base with payments cut. low enough for them to meet with ease.

      "Please, do something for the soldiers, add special attention to the boys that has been over. I feel most certain it will be [unclear] [/unclear] [unclear] [/unclear] to draft young men for the [unclear] peace [/unclear] time army because my contact with the men that are here [unclear] [/unclear] seem to have such a unpleasant feeling towards the army life. I admit a may be the [unclear] possibility [/unclear] of going into battle that causes the condition. I am sure there will be [unclear] reason [/unclear] to draft here how the [unclear] [/unclear] [unclear] [/unclear] . I think soldiers should be allowed to act on a bill like that. There have been Thousands of men thrown together and they have [unclear] learned [/unclear] more about the other things they [unclear] [/unclear] thoughts. The White man has learned that the negro is a real red blooded American like he Thinks the same. And dream the same So if and when such a bill comes out let the soldiers vote that. This I have on communication with soldiers of both races. \n",
      "For the army, I think care should be taken on placing its [unclear] [/unclear] where they are best filled. Much talent, skill, willingness and moral [morale] has been lost due to this gross miscalculation and lack of manifested interest in our problems. The entire source of energy should be used in bringing the war to an end, not just parts of it. Someone should awaken to these very important factors. The problem of the minority groups in this country will necessitate a complete study, deep understanding and spontaneous action. Allowing such conditions to exist in the country will inevitably deteriorate the fundamental principles of our constitution. I think this country lives [unclear] contrary [/unclear] to the doctrines it advocates. Let there be an inventory taken by all.\n",
      "The [deletion] [/deletion] only thing that I have to say about the conditions in the United States is that I hope that the Government will do something about Jim Crowism because if I get married and raise a family I want my children to have the best and they cant have it the way they are Jim Crowing Negroes out of college where they can get special training.\n",
      "First: I think we should have more negro officers in the army. There are a number of men whom I think have never had a fare [fair] break to show what they really know. It seems to me that a man with the best connections gets the best job whether he can do the job well or not rather than the the man that has [insertion] the [/insertion] better qualifications. I think a man should be given a chance to show his ability at least. Second: I think after the war that a man that has served in the arm forces should get the first choice at everything.\n",
      "I don't have very much to say concerning the army. Perhaps a man with a different attitude, something for the army's good, could say something better. How eager I am to leave the army. The sooner or the better would be highly appreciated. Any young men that love having a private life will and can understand my feeling. I'll say again that there is also too much log rolling [unclear] [/unclear] with the army for personal dealings.\n",
      "I think if we in this company were treated more as men and given more chance to do as we wanted in our jobs the moral would be much higher. We here are being treated very much as children and most of us resent it. One thing we have too many old officers from other branches of the service and the don't seem to realize that mood of the fellows are not here because the want to bat because they have to. Another thing if I had never had been sent south I might have been proud of the uniform I am wareing but as long as conditions are like they are in the south and as long as I not considered as a negro and not a soldier I will always wonder what I am doing in the army and will not be satisfied with it.\n",
      "There are a great many things I want to say but time nor space permits me to say it here. In the first place Negroes are tired of sheding Blood for the So-Called Democracy that he does not receive. Most of us feel that we have little or nothing to fight for. All of this will have to change. I do not feel that I should go to Germany to fight Nazis when we have a lot of them just across the old Mason Dixon line. There are countless cases of mistreatment of the Negros in southern army camps and they are ignored by the army. The Northern Colored Sholdier [soldier] would rather get over seas than to train by one in the [unclear] soutly [/unclear] . And this will be forgotten after the war. [paragraph] I would also like to See the Government take a better stand on the rights of the Negress now and after war. If this is not done then we will have to take one ourselves. You see I am a Negress Sholdier. [soldier]\n",
      "The army could have better facilities for soldiers, especially Negro soldiers. All soldiers are in one Army; They should be treated as on, and not separate groups[paragraph] If they cant live in the Army together, how can the two live in the U.S.A.?

There has been no change in the betterment of the soldiers.\n",
      "Even thowe the allied nations might physically win the war, morally and ethically we have already lost. We have [unclear] retrogress [/unclear] of many years and our form of law and order is shallow and void of Just principles.

Is our reward enough to allay our fears and losses while in the army.\n",
      "On the Demobilization plan - I wonder if the fellows that belong to the regular army but have never been over seas get a fair deal I have read in newspaper recently that the fellows with combat service & medals of merit will get the venefit [benefit] of the doubt after all they didn't on a whole volunteer for overseas - if there unit was called upon to render service in a combat area they had to go on out, it would be the same more or less most of the soldiers that are not over seas [unclear] [/unclear] if they were over there it would bring the war to an end sooner - [unclear] [/unclear] [unclear] [/unclear] pretty bad to give the soldier over seas the benefit of the doubt if they don't have families or if they aren't wounded any man will fight to defend the things he love.\n",
      "I am a negro and as such I feel with the majority that the Army is a rotten place for our race. A uniform in this part of the country (the South) does not mean a thing on a colored soldier. My letter carrier's uniform brings me much more respect and recognition from the opposite race than this one ever did. Give me back my better civilian uniform and let me be a man. This Army life only makes an embittered person out of most negroes. I have found from my little experience of 22 months.\n",
      "I don't believe the negro of America will get the break that most of us expect to get when the war is over. First, I say this because most of the fighting troops are white, and most likely they will return to their homes first, whereas most of the negros are in labor Battalions and they will be left to do the \"Policing\". By the time these troops return, most of the best jobs will be occupied by the white veterans. This in turn will cause much resentment by the negro troops, and probably will result in race riots and other disagreements between the races. The one thing that will break down conflict between negro and white troops is to let them live together, fight together and this way each one will come to know the other better, and america in the end will be the Democracy it is supposed to be now.\n",

[paragraph] If our leaders fail to do this we will have lost one of the first great causes for which this war is being fought I think the president should [unclear] tel a lman white step [/unclear] to see to it that all of this be abolished before and service man return to civilian life to save a lot of blood shed and misery plus the lives that will be lost [unclear] necllerly [/unclear] .

      "To my personal thoughts I think the army has been fairly good to me but I don't think I have been given the chance that I think I should have had. The reason is I get out and train hard as anybody else I think but it seems that I don't get as much credit as others but I am not hurt over it. It is the army ways so i have been told. I think the conditions of the US will be very good acording to post war plans if they are carried out as they should be and give all servicemen and women a fair break. Some people hardly think of the women's army Corps but deserved as much a break as the sevicemen but I hope the post war plans will be very very good.\n",

      "Why do we have to have so much training in one type of service? I don't like training for months. I would rather fight. I mean in a particular type of service. Why don't the Negro get a chance to show his ability to think by letting more of them perform \"combat duty\". I don't think there should be an election of Presidents during War time. \n",

If I am any better of after the war it will be [unclear] entirely [/unclear] through my own efforts and if not I will have what I had when I entered this country plus a wife, though I do not feel obligated to the country in the least and as to its standing after the war its of little concern to me.\n",

      "Things could be made better in the Army, now. I want to see every man have a fair break after the war. A chance to live where he wants, hold any job he can do well. Give all Army men a fair chance at jobs that 4F field now even that's 4Fs is better the 4Fs has given much, make all the money. We could not even put much of our pay in war bonds to save, he could. 4Fs should not want good paying jobs, he could have saved. Don't let them try to run over us.\n",

I know as for me I want more of a chance because I am serving with the best of my ability in the Cause. And I think there are too many Negroes being thrown in the Service Forces. There are a lot of healthy young men in the Services Force. They should be in a branch that will require their skill and health.\n",

As far as this is concerned the American [unclear] Negro [/unclear] has a majority of the say now in a way of speaking. I take notice from the last war. If you remember Washington when the bonus marchers marched to the capital of the US they were beat up by the soldier at [unclear] [/unclear] . It was terrible. I wish that that would not happen after this war. I want a soldier to have his equal rights. If there is a bonus coming up for himin good time I want him to receive it without any trouble. The man who served overseas should get [unclear] [/unclear] first. I hope the war is over very soon & all married men with families will be released first.\n",
      "I think that I could have did more for the cause out of the army than I have did in it because so far the things I have did were not very important to me in my eye sight. My house has been torn up my mother left in bad shape because I was always my mothers chief support. I'm not making any kind of money to send home. don't get me wrong I am not kidding my country is at war and if they figured they needed me I was ready to go. Although my chances were not very good for me to get ahead at the present time. I want to know if the negro will be any further advanced after this war. I was some what depressed when I came into the army seeing as how some of my people were treated. People white race actually didn't want my people working beside them so I said why should we fight beside them.\n",
      "After serving my time in the Army Services I am hoping to get a better job after the war than I had before and expect to have the rights and freedom as any other American Citizen and am looking forward to the elimination of segregation and the bettering of conditions among the Negro race through out the country - especially the south. As a citizen and being call to serve my country this is what I am expecting after the war and will do everything I possibly can to see that this is done.\n",
      "I think that all colored units should have colored officers because no white officer will do as much for another race as his own. I think that all colored outfits are proving now that they are as good as any white outfit that there is an the war would probably be over with more all-colored outfits. I think that my dislike for the army has came because of these southern white officers who think that a negro is not as smart an good as they are. Our outfit is a good as any, but these white officers we have here would break any good soldiers morale. I do believe that I am as good as any man in the world. I have seen many a good soldier in my outfit turn out to be a bad soldier.\n",
      "Why is it that any person can into the United States get better treatment then the Negro and they were born here. Why is it that the Negro's are looked upon as a low class of people's? Now after the war I am asking you that are in power to please give the Negro's a chance and after giving them a chance give them just ?. And then the rest will kind of transform And now will have better certain of those that to ? past in ? treat them as they are to part of the arm forces. Because they have proven to the world that can do as well as & they really have the initiation of\n",
      "[unclear] [/unclear] Personally I don't give a damned about conditions after the war in the United States of America. Maybe its because they were no good before the war. For many a time I have heard the words. Sorry don't hire colored people. So as far as I am concerned they can stick Army, Navy, Marines and the Armed forces up their asses.\n",
      "The first point I want to bring out is this [insertion] ; [/insertion] we are fighting a war for the preservation of Democracy. How in the world can we fight for something we can't have at home. The army should be a shining example of democracy but sad our present Army is today it is everything but that. In my discharge I just hope and wish that this question of Race could be solved giving the Negro the rights of an American. Make him proud to say that he is an American citizen and member of the [unclear] [/unclear] that not only preaches democracy but also practices it.\n",
      "The United States must make plans, then take positive forceful action on them, to eliminate the many injustices to various minorities based upon race, creed, or nationality. Equality of EVERY and ANY kind is the only acceptable basis for a civilized and fair relationship of one human being for another. For this I GLADLY serve as a member of the Armed Forces. For any less - discrimination, insults of southern areas, particularly while in what is understand to be the uniform of the United States Army - I again feel like \"a prisoner within the US Army sentenced to punishment for the fallacy of \"white\" or any other kind of \"superiority\". The relative disparity of recreational opportunity for colored and white troops on and off post in good example of the need for application of the aforementioned principles. I am acquainted with these differences because my Army work is directly concerned with such. \n",
      "I firmly believe, much to my regret, that the American people do not really believe in what they are supposed to be fighting for. With a hypocritical smugness born of years of continual rationalization instead of self-criticism, most Americans loudly proclaim the four freedoms with one hand while with the other they continue to oppress minority groups in their own country. Racial groups who have fought, bled and died in an effort to keep this country \"free\" have been treated in much the same manner as the people of those countries we are fighting to liberate. Only a people who have lived and suffered under oppression can know the real meaning of the word \"equality.\" America has long since forgotten 1776. Americans on the whole have not suffered enough in this war to gain any moral benefit from it. Their suffering has been an individual not a mass basis. Then in war the American people have not been able to overlook their petty dislikes, discriminations and hatreds. How can these, who found no time to rise above their personal dislikes and hatreds in war ever hope to prosper in peace? \n",
      "The conditions that persist to exist in the majority of the states against the negro soldier is deplorable. How in the hell do you or they expect one to have a bosom full of patriotism when everywhere one go he's the object of ridicule - Jim Crow conditions - and as always taken for a fool -- [unclear] [/unclear] I could write you a book on this subject, but if a War Dept. Directive (No. 97 July 43 - since reproduced) cannot change these conditions then what can I write here that would? No I don't care for the Army, and as long as I have to serve my country and contend with what my country serves me in return, I'll never like it. Sure if I have to fight I will, but only because the first law of nature is \"self preservation.\" Personally, I could wage a much more successful war against such personages as Rankins, Bilbo, Sparks and his beleaguered colleagues. On the whole, the army stinks that's my opinion & I'll stick by my guns.\n",
      "I have noticed among the soldiers an inclination to worry and think of home when they are allowed to sit around with nothing to do. I would suggest more things to occupy a soldiers mind when he is not training or working, such as organized athletics, entertainments, and opportunities to learn more about specific subjects that the soldier is interested in. Also I think that the Negro would make a much more willing an interested soldier if he were allowed to train in the Northern states, away from the discrimination and [unclear] [/unclear] racism shown him in the South. This would not only help his moral but help to give them a feeling that he was actually fighting for a better America instead of the same thing we have to contend with now. Also if we had more Negro officers we would have more pride in our outfit.\n",
      "I think the conditions in the united states should be a lot better for the colored race after the war. The race as a whole should be given the utmost chance to live higher and to make more money. He must be given a chance this time. He should be given more chance for government jobs. The United States should not hold against the colored people as a whole. For what a few people do. About the army well I will just be damn glad to go home for good.\n",
      "After the war I think [insertion] the [/insertion] Army should look out for Ex-servace [ex-service] men fully. They should have first chance to all [deletion] [/deletion] and any jobs they prefer. And to those who are disabled cripple blind and etc. should be treated with the best of care no prejective what ever. What I mean just don't send them so much a month, not knowing their conditions. But treat them as they were treate while in service. Lookout for them to the fullest estent. And too the guys who are able to work I think they should be able to borry [borrow] a certain amount of money from the Government to get started. I'll say about two or threr [three] thousands dollors [dollars] ($3,000) with about twenty or twenty five years to pay. With an intrest [interest] of three or four cent on a dollor [dollar] \n",
      "It is really a pity and a shame that the people of this world are so narrow. How can we criticize Hitler and Co. for his cruel treatment of minorities when we practice the same thing? On what ground do we find power to compel anyone to do right instead of wrong save though the virtue of our might is our right? There are towns in this state, Texas, in which I cannot even go to pick up a telegram or cash a money order. Yet right here I have just completed with my unit the satisfactory passing of tests that have shown us qualified as soldiers who can effectively fight and die for the perseverance of social equality with liberty and justice for all. Come now the army can at least clean up its own back yard. Moreover the nation should back the rights it gives to man through the supreme court. (meaning voting privilege) Its a laugh and don't think it isn't a [unclear] nazi [/unclear] background for Hitler propaganda.\n",

I felt that this is one point should be handled like a baby more less nursed.

A few [unclear] corrections [/unclear] are being made gradually but not fast enough for all to benefit by them.

Are we not humans as the white or any other race. Should nothing be done about it in the right manner. I'm sure the men from overseas not only over here that have spent plenty of time will not take things as before. There will be plenty of lives lost in that range. I myself have few I would want to put away. Why are we fighting in the beginning & what have we done to fight. Of for God's sake somebody tell me that. Can you. Maybe in years to come some body will tell me that at present I cannot see it at all. Why am I unvalued?\n",
      "I think that since colored soldiers have played their parts so well in this war that they should be given a better chance to live like any body else after the war. They should be given a fair chance, we can leave the better off. I hope that when we soldiers get out of the Army that we will be able to get jobs as we were promised before we came in.\n",

[paragraph] I think a man would serve his country better if he was placed in a unit where he wants to serve. I know that some units would not have enough men, the unit that have list men would encrease their pay then they would have plenty. Any man would change his mind for more money. Then we would have a lovely army. \n",
      "I don't feel that the Army goes to any great lengths to see that I am given the opportunities due to me as a soldier & citizen of the U.S. I feel that I have been prejudiced against in the Army and consequently cannot serve my country to my fullest capacity. The Army could get much better results if they treated all soldiers as such.\n",

I think colored and white should be treated as equal, because all we want is right and nothing else. What the White man is afraid as if the Colored man might get a step ahead of him, that way we keep his eyes on the Aryan race. After the war a soldier should be given an allotment until he gets on his feet.\n",
      "I don't think the negro soldiers should be restricted in different town because after all we are giving our lives for the white people also, and I think we should be able to go in their places as well as they came in ours. I don't think the President is trying to do much to stop it. I do hope these things wont exist after the war is over. Think Germany and Japan should be broke up entirely, and mix them with other people who don't think of wars. \n",
      "The Army of the U.S. is a very effective organization. It is something to be proud of. I would feel much better I'm sure and maintain that forever talked about esprit de corps if there were more officers in the Army representing my race. It is very demoralizing to train an outfit some period of years in a branch of service that requires great skill and knowledge, and then break up an outfit of this nature to send overseas to do some common jobs as loading and unloading vessels. It's a terrible waste of man power, money and good efforts of our troops who are doing the utmost to win this war. \n",
      "I would like to get the same break in life as everyone is getting. I think as a whole me and my race is on the crumy end of ever thing and not getting what we are fighting for. My life mean as much to me[unclear] a [/unclear] the rest of the people so why should I risk it in the same way and only have half the good to gain. If the Governament can draft me and make me fight, then they should improve my condition in the South. They can if they will and want to. \n",
      "I think that compulsory military training for America, youth would be advantageous because you will then have a strong young efficient army. It will also take up some of the slack on unemployment & the contacts that are made & the rights & conditions in the different parts of the country will help to bring [unclear] [/unclear] tolerance as the closer contacts between men of the north, south, east & wests, Black & White will help them to realize that we are all just plain men. It will afford education & opportunities to some who would never have had them & I think that while in the service they should have to go to school, but be given a chance to go to the school that they desire or learn a trade that they want to do. The I.Q. of the country will be raised & maybe in time we will have a Democracy. I also thing that all soldiers should receive the same training, regardless of race, creed or color. All should be taught about firearms.\n",
      "I hope the conditions after the war, in the United States are changed, there are many things I could say, but particular the racial problem. I feel that the American Negro soldier, the 10% of the Army, the 14% of the front lines, will find the Mr. Charlies of America will still have the back doors, and back streets open for him, the equality and democracy he fought for is still not ready to share with him his rightful place in society. In all walks of life, the road to success is the longest for the dark skin boy, and always there is the inferiority example between races. I'd like to see all America stand in one solemn oath and say \"Wee, the inhabitants of this land, are all true Americans.\" There is nothing Sen. [Senator] Bilbo and his kind can do to change this way of life.\n",
      "[unclear] [/unclear] and [unclear] [/unclear] the race we all are in the army with one definite goal and that is to win the war as quick as possible so we can go back to our families and friends, since that is the thought of all men in the arm forces whether he be White, Black, Red, or yellow. Why doesn't the army enforce the laws which will make all men equal whether he be in New York or Georgia. The four freedom, we are fighting for why not enjoy them while we are in the Army. In so doing it will give all soldiers sometime to look forward to after the war.\n",

I would love to see the time come when one man regardless to race or color be looked upon as the other.\n",
      "This has been a long war and very painful for many families. I think the Negros are doing a fine job. After this war is over, The Negro should be freed from more pregudese. I think segregation should be abolished from the earth for ever. I think we should live all as one. Be our Brother's keeper. This is what we are fighting for, the rights to live as a free American.\n",
      "I think some provisions should be made to look out for the ex-service men when the war is over. Especially in giving him a good job. Because the most of the men have sacrificed a lot. There isn't any future in the army. You can only go so far. Every man is trying to gain something and there's only a little that the army has to offer.\n",
      "I think that no Negroes should have been drafted under the conditions which he lives, such as the south. It should have been purely voluntary. All of those who felt as though they had something to fight for, let them volunteer. After all, Negroes were drafted to this country as slave. Should they fight for something that was forced upon them? I think it is unlawful; unless Negroes are treated as any other human being. In the Army their rights are limited as well as in civilian life. Are they dying for better or worse? You be the Judge.\n",
      "I really think the Army was ment to be run right, but there are a lot of places that the High Commands don't know or would believe is run the way they are. There are a lot of ways things could be better & then a fellow would not feel that he is in a Prison instead of the Army of the United States. I have learn a lot since being in thee army but can't help but hate a lot of things that may be is not [unclear] [/unclear] to every one in higher Command. We will have a great Army when this has been looked in to & corrected.\n",

I think the race riots should be discontinued and that every man, [unclear] man [/unclear] , women and children should have more respect for one another. And every man should give his fellow brothers a helping hand.

      "Speaking for myself, I've found the South to be very unfair. Why is more than I can say, unless it goes back to the old post-Racial prejudices. The war itself could hardly been averted but if Democracy is all that is signified the colored soldiers would feel that they've really got a country behind them (equal rights for all) rather than a bunch of ignorant and prejudice whites (in the army and out) who think colored people (soldiers) are only fit to eat, drink and think like cattle. Apart from the rest of the humans. The prisoners of war are treated better than the Negro soldiers. [paragraph] [This I have experienced] [paragraph] \n",
      "I hope that after the war Negroes are given an equal chance in the industrial and social life which surely will be different to that one prior to the war. I am for: compulsory education with no segregation. I think if the white race (the southerners especially) were educated more (especially along the lines of social equality), there would be less conflict and strife between the two races. The condition that exists in the South is deplorable. The Negro is [deletion] kept [/deletion] suppressed both socially + industrially. I shall never come South again unless forced to. The condition here in the South tears down all that one has learned and believed about good government. It is an insult to the words \"democratic government.\" We are fighting to destroy the same things we will be forced to return to in civilian life.\n",
      "[unclear] [/unclear] To my opinion thinks we should have a standard army after the war. But that doesn't include the older men. I think the government should give the soldier a job and some financial start after the war. There are hundreds of soldiers in the armed service who are not physical fit for duty. Why keep them. [unclear] homes will have to be [unclear] after the war. That means starting all over again. Give us jobs an a fair pay that is all we ask.\n",
      "I'm hoping that the people of the United States will realize the common brotherhood of man and treat all as such. There should be a greater participation of people in the elections and running of the government. Veterans returning to civilian life should not consider themselves as experts on how all state, local, and Federal government agencies should run. If the government can mobilize to fight an All-Out action in a military war, it should be able to combat unemployment and economic distresses with the same determination. If the greater majority of people can enjoy food, clothing, and shelter, on what we call the American Standard of Living, social living and conditions will become better. Equal and Identical opportunities should be given to all people regardless of Race, Creed or Color. That's what we are fighting for and it's worth it!!!\n",
      "After the war I hope we Americans will have a chance to make a decient [decent] living for our familys [families] but it will be hard if we are going to let foreigners come in + rape the country + starve us who have deprive our homes + our familys [families] of the decient [decent] things to go to battle for this Country + there he pushed around by some guy catn's {can't] even speak our language\n",
      "I wish it to be understood that I fully realize that there are men in the army who may be more qualified for all the various schools than I but it seems to me they ought to find some kind of a duty besides manual labor entirely even for one who many will say be illiterate. If one cannot learn to be any aid at all to his country in the Army they in my opinion should release him. Myself, I have volunteered for overseas duty but was turned down. I am both mentally and physically qualified though. I reach the conclusion that there are more men in the Armed forces than they know what to do with. I think while the war is going on, they should send pages 3 and 4 of this questionnaire to all the camps in the Country and place the negative answers in a place more suitable for them and their country.\n",
      "I feel that the government could should [show] a great deal more interest in the negro people not after the war, not tomorrow - but now. I've ran into so much prejudice that I do feel that no man will give to another equal rights; politically, socially or economically. So be it with the negro and white. I would like to see the Gov. show more interest in the negro people now than they showed before\n",
      "The Army is a fine place to be if a man has nothing else to do. It can make or brake a man by that I mean to give a man too much of the same training.

You have my best wishes for God speed and all of my luck.\n",
      "One thing that the Negros are not being treated like they should. And I think if the treatment was improved in the South for them for their rights, they would feel a lots better, then having son's lost in war and then are treated like they are. We don't feel to fight, and then our family are not getting treatment like they should.\n",
      "I am a colored soldier drafted into the army from the north Pennsylvania and not strayed to a Southern State ugly Southern Affairs and as a whole we have pretty tough treatment under such circumstances. You ask for a particular branch of the Army and are sent most anyplace. I am in the [deletion] [/deletion] [unclear] Anclat [/unclear] Engineers. My platoon Commander from Tennessee (white) treats us like we were dogs and thinks we are all fools. After the war most of us will not [deletion] [/deletion] get our jobs back. A colored soldier is not respected especially in the South. Still we are called upon and sent across seas to fight and give our lives for *our* country and our called the lower race. We are not equal in the eyes of most white persons to them and I think something could be done about it\n",
      "I think that the Army of the US should accept all the volunteers to make up its army of occupation instead of drafting men with children and wifes. Also that the Army should find men who have no ? at least a very little race prejudice to run or obtain high marks in their army. At present I don't think they have given it very much consideration. That is what I think makes the Negro soldier feel resentful to most of his Southern Battery Commanders and Officers.\n",
      "The army is nice for every one to be in once. There are little things a man can't get use to. His time really isn't his own, but they don't have to take all of that away. He wants to go home some time & stay there enough time to enjoy his self. So far get the daily things he knows he must do as a soldier. ([paragraph] ) Never the less we realize there is a war going on. But some of the stuff they put on you is unnecessary that is what make men hate the army & makes desertion.

      "I should like to feel that we [unclear] [/unclear] , especially we Negro [unclear] [/unclear] , will find here at home the democracy we're supposed to be fighting for. From my service thus far I can't see that I've anything to gain either personally or as a group because of the army policy of relegating us to servile positions. Rather than for the democracy the army has proven to me that my station in life regardless of my sacrifices will always be governed by my color. My heritage of life, liberty and Pursuit of Happiness is still to me a shallow phrase and will be as long as my choice of jobs, places to live etc. are restricted to menial tasks and [unclear] [/unclear] living quarters.\n",
      "I think inter-racial conditions in this country are deplorable and that they will for the most part be the same or worse after the war. Consequently I fail to see any gain in anything except the same mess after the war is won. It makes me wonder just what I am fighting for, at times. Then to is the fact that men of all races, colors & creeds are dying and shedding their blood for America & they have not been treated as Americans before & probably not after the war.\n",
      "I know that the army is a necessary element for any country. In earlier years I would have like to be in the army very much. I think a soldier is a fine tribute to his country. But my age & with 5 in my family, I think I would be of better service to my country & my family on the home front in some industry. Like the one I was in. My country & family needs me very much in that way. I could [be] of service to both. I hope & believe conditions will be better for most of the people. Some will never go or be able to go into life like before. What if every one feels the way I do I [am sure we will gain by our experience in the army. I will appreciate my country & home more & try to make us a better place to live. May God be willing\n",
      "I think the Army & the U.S.A. are the best in the world. I am ashamed that I haven't done more for my country. I wish I had been drafted in 1940 or 41 - I could have done much more. It was a mistake to build T.A.A.F. in a Southern state as the southern states & local communities have too much influence over the installation in regard to Negros. [paragraph] It also seems that selection of Negros & some whites as officer was poorly done - In too many instances it amounts to the \"blind leading the blind\". Opportunities for Negros as far as a adornment is covered is most discouraging, and the army as a whole suffers from it. This is also true of white to some extent too. [paragraph] I would be much happier in a Norther Camp - & just move this camp to ILL. Mich. or Wisconsin. \n",
      "There is only one subject that is on my mind and every other \"colored\" soldier. \"The Racial Problem\". The white people of the United States are not being as fair as they could & should be.

We are in here [unclear] [/unclear] like any one else with only a little hope and very much doubt to whether the Racist Problems will be solved. Just because we are boron or Black doesn't mean we are dogs does it? hell no. Someone better wake up and realize we are humans just as you or they are. All we are asking is a chance, can we have it.

I believe the government should be the first to [insertion] abolish [/insertion] all forms of segregation form all of its agencies + branches. \n",
      "[deletion] [/deletion] I think if things go on much longer like they are now, my job wont be of any use to me after the war is over.

      "Yes -- it is felt by me and those with whom I associate that equality throughout the Army has not been granted. That if each soldier no matter what creed color or race could feel reasonably sure that fair employment throughout the United States could be granted each of its citizens; a deeper interest on the part of all soldiers could be assured. That if the people chosen to represent the great masses of citizens [insertion] in the Senate and Congress [/insertion] could but realize the race hatred is costing the United States countless millions of dollars through the ages and the next and immediate mission of the Army should be [deletion] [/deletion] to correct this terrible mistake in this great democracy of ours.\n",
      "I hope that after this war a person will be judge by what he can do, not by his connections as far as knowing the, so called big shots. Also I have been in the South as a solider, it would be really an advance in the civilization of this great democracy if the Negroes of the south were given a square deal as they should be. The conditions in some of the places were awful.\n",
      "Speaking for myself I should think the question of employment should best be answered by a mans ability. Employment is still the countrys greatest problem, and probably always will. A string of medals should not be used to influence a prospective employer because they are too easily obtained. You can get the purple heart simply by cutting your finger here in the U.S.A. between the hours of 0600 and 1800 (duty hours). A colonel in the field Artillary [artillery] could hardly be expected to sucessfuly [successfully] be a mechanic and yet many an officer will be employed post war simply because he was an officer. [paragraph] Will the army ever learn to place \"all\" men according to their ability - instead of by the requirements of the Army? and most of all when they start giving out jobs will a colonel get a \"Good job\" and a pvt the scrapings? time will tell\n",
      "I believe that after the war men who cannot early ajust themselves will be at a loss to correct such a problem If adjustment of men to new in[unclear] [/unclear] , more stress should be given to personal [unclear] [/unclear] by the Army before it becomes a major problem. Due to the chance of individual living states brought about by enlistment or draft[unclear] [/unclear] in the Army School should be [unclear] [/unclear] throughout the Continental United States to educate or train exservice ment after the war \n",
      "Well, I hope I can get out of the army soon for I am not as strong as I was when I came in. I think the Army should let all men over 37 out of the army, for if they feel like I do they are beat out. I feel like I am 70 years old. And if the army let old me out now, they might be able to buy them a home before they go down. Some of them might live 10 or 12 years longer. And I hope to get my same job back. And to have the equal rights to buy what I want and what I need.\n",
      "I think any man in the army should be place in an outfit where he would be more of a help to the army and to himself.

      "The Colored man at present in the U.S. Army is not given a [deletion] [/deletion] chance as the white man. I think any man in Service Clothes should be treated the same regardless of his color. [paragraph] After the war a colored man should be treated the same as a white man. If we have won. Because he has fought and died just as the white man. All Soldiers should be given the first chance for all Government Jobs, Federal, State and etc. [paragraph] Right now things aren't going on as they should. [paragraph] I don't like it.\n",
      "I feel as the [unclear] Govt. [/unclear] should abide by the Constitution of the U.S. for every race regardless of Color, Creed or religion & give every man a chance for jobs weather he's in the North or South and stop letting a few States bar a man. I feel as if there will arise another Civil War or worse in the states after the war. [paragraph] The army should choose men according to their mental ability & not for his loudness & size for jobs in the armed forces.\n",
      "I realize that irrespective of where an individual is placed in the Army, he should endeavor to his utmost to do the job that's assigned to him. That sort of thing helps to win the war, but sometimes a man can do more if he is assigned to something that is is familiar with. Quite a number of individuals have been done a grave injustice because of not being assigned properly. On the other hand let us look at the ever increasing numbers whose morale are lowered because of these injustices. Some individuals do their work in accordance to the way they feel and this depressing of their morale. no matter how infinitesimal will cause a decrease in efficiency. Frankly speaking, I believe that if a little more emphasis was placed on Assignment of soldiers, whether they be black or white, they efficiency would be greatly increased.\n",
      "In regards to questions on conditions after the ward there are many things I would like to ask: First after being in the army, spending time and sweat I would like to know why because of Race do a soldier have to put up with such [unclear] pred [/unclear] as we have [deletion] [/deletion] I really hope after the war we will be able to get the equal chances - not in mingling in races but as a race. \n",
      "You don't give the colored man a fair break in this army. If this is my country as well as the white man's we should be given better chances and opportunities.

They don't do anything but sit down and BS [bullshit] and get all the money while the enlisted man is suffering[.] [paragraph] They want to give colored soldiers here section VIII's instead of CDOs when they are physical wrecks.\n",
      "I am very much afraid the Ex-soldiers won't be able to get jobs after the war. There will also be more race [unclear] distenben-cies [/unclear] after the war. I also think the Ex-service men will be better men after the war.\n",

[paragraph] \n",
      "I am also very interested in the progress of the Negro race that should be made after the war. I say that because I feel that the \"Negro\" will want more than \"He\" did before the war. I speak mainly as an individual on this subject and not as a incompetent group. The segregation of people in different parts of the country has been the cause of my \"Jim Crow\" practices. As an \"American\" I feel that segregation should be suppressed as much as possible, and the \"Four Freedoms\" granted to every American despite race, color, or creed. \n",
      "I personally do not think that the U.S. Gov. believes that they are allowing the American Negro the chance he deserves. Those hard fighting patriotic American soldiers can not return home from overseas and enjoy the things they have fought and died for, Freedom. The Negro is conscious of what's going on he is also familiar with the Constitution and he knows that the Four Freedoms don't apply to him yet he fights to perserve them. He knows there is no equality in no sense of the word and I fear there will be quite a lot of unrest when the Negro boys come back. They're not fighting to perserve Jim Crow, unfair employment practices and the right to pay taxes and not the right to vote. The Negro can't take anything from the white man. All he wants is to be left alone and live like any other American Citizens. Why can't the Negro have Franchisement. Why can't he compete. Why can't there be Negro Commanders in the Armed Forces.\n",
      "My race is treated bad in certain section of the country. I think they would be treated the same as the white soldier. We are fighting the same thing and why should we be jim crow in certain section of the country. I alway think what is the negro soldier fighting. I hope when the war is over, we will git the same break as the white soldier. I hope the southern states will come to life that the colored soldier has the same break as white soldier when this war is over. There has been so many slurs about the Southern camps that it make a colored soldier mad. If they don't come to life there is [unclear] soon [/unclear] to be a civil war in the South. \n",
      "I feel that I am unjustly treated in the Army, by that I mean I don't get the equal break that the white soldier get. It seems that we are put on Army posts and don't have the same things for recreation. We have guest houses and service club. They are not large enough to accommodate us when the white soldier has the best of everything. I feel if I am to fight in this war for democracy, at least the Army should be fare with us as well as the white boys. I think this is a very poor way of [unclear] securing [/unclear] that all citizens of the US are treated on equal basis as the constitution read. \n",
      "I don't like the way that civilians are [striking/unclear] and delaying the out put of much needed war materials which are needed in all fighting fronts.

The action of the Southern democrats in congress has made this complicated that we can't be sure of our freedom. This I'm going to demand and I'm willing to give all that I have to assure myself and my race \"Freedom\" everywhere.

      "I'd like to say something about discrimination. When we speak of the \"army\" there is very little thought given to discrimination. We are to be the solid mass, but when it comes to privileges and things in that category then there is segregation. We're fighting together, side by side. Why can't it be looked upon as all the same color and not like some one that has eyes for only one color, and if you're not that color then you are not known and not welcomed. I am only one, but I am sure that I can easily be speaking for many others that see this great injustice. It is true we are all created equal, why not have equal rights?\n",
      "In Header: Artillery and put them in What you May Called a shit group. Answer below question 85.: The Army has taught me something that will be a lasting memory. The experience [unclear] [/unclear] from this could not be bought with money. I realize that I am an American, because I was born here, but for this being a war on, I must admit I have been treated worst, worst[deletion] than before. This Lead (led) me to think that even if I am an American, I am only being used because I am here.

      "I personally think exservicemen should get some consideration as to jobs, training schooling after the war. I don't think veterans should be given the cream of everything. After all the civilians have did their share to help win this conflict. I do believe that all men upon reaching the age of 19 or 20 should have some military training. Good sound military training teaches a young man cleanliness, poise, level headness and conditions the body and mind so he can tackle the problems of life later on.\n",
      "The army as a whole is all right but it doesnt [doesn't] allow the young man a chance. He can only advance in small scales that tends to lower his morale feeling and give him the idea that he is here only because men must be for their Country and the young man is most preferred.

And too after the war the people will not stand for Other people walking over them as before. I think there will be more equal rights. We will all so take advantage of all opportunities ofered moreso than before. As for the Army Regulations they are made for all But in Most Cases it seems as though the colored Race is neglected, and something is added or either something taken away and there fore All the Soldiers are not treated the same. As for this camp Here it sees as thought the peoples here don't want the colored raced here and on the other hand they still continue to send them here.

Soldiers came back home they could not get jobs and the Government claim that they were not able to place them.
